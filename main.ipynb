composable API for HTTP ReadmeChangelogExampleInstallingVersionsScores A composable library for making HTTP requests This package contains a set of functions and classes that make it easy to consume HTTP resources It mobile desktop and browser and supports multiple implementations Using The easiest way to use this library is via the functions They allow you to make individual HTTP requests with minimal hassle import as http var url var response await url body print status print body print await Note Flutter applications may require additional configuration to make HTTP requests If you making multiple requests to the same server you can keep open a persistent connection by using a Client rather than making requests If you do this make sure to close the client when you done var client try var response await body var decodedResponse jsonDecode as Map var uri decodedResponse as String print await uri finally Tip For detailed background information and practical usage examples see Dart Development Fetch data from the internet Flutter Cookbook Fetch data from the internet The Flutter HTTP example application You can also exert more control over your requests and responses by creating Request or StreamedRequest objects yourself and passing them to This package is designed to be composable This makes it easy for external libraries to work with one another to add behavior to it Libraries wishing to add behavior should create a subclass of BaseClient that wraps another Client and adds the desired behavior class UserAgentClient extends final String userAgent final UserAgentClient Future send request userAgent return request Retrying requests package provides a class RetryClient to wrap an underlying which transparently retries failing requests import as http import Future void main async final client RetryClient try print await finally By default this retries any request whose response has status code Temporary Failure up to three retries It waits before the first retry and increases the delay by each time All of this can be customized using the RetryClient constructor Choosing an implementation There are multiple implementations of the package http Client interface By default package http uses BrowserClient on the web and IOClient on all other platforms You an choose a different Client implementation based on the needs of your application You can change implementations without changing your application code except for a few lines of configuration Some well supported implementations are Implementation Supported Platforms SDK Caching Platform Native package http IOClient Android iOS Linux macOS Windows Dart Flutter package http BrowserClient Web Dart Flutter package CupertinoClient iOS macOS Flutter package CronetClient Android Flutter package FetchClient Web Dart Flutter Tip If you are writing a Dart package or Flutter pluggin that uses package http you should not depend on a particular Client implementation Let the application author decide what implementation is best for their project You can make that easier by accepting an explicit Client argument For example Future Album fetchAlbum Client client async client Client Configuration To use a HTTP client implementation other than the default you must Add the HTTP client as a dependency Configure the HTTP client Connect the HTTP client to the code that uses it Add the HTTP client as a dependency To add a package compatible with the Dart SDK to your project use dart pub add For example Replace with the package that you want to use dart pub add To add a package that requires the Flutter SDK use flutter pub add For example Replace with the package that you want to use flutter pub add Configure the HTTP client Different package http Client implementations may require different configuration options Add a function that returns a correctly configured Client You can return a different Client on different platforms For example Client httpClient if final engine cacheMode cacheMaxSize return engine if final config cache memoryCapacity return config return IOClient Tip The Flutter HTTP example application demonstrates configuration best practices Supporting browser and native If your application can be run in the browser and natively you must put your browser and native configurations in seperate files and import the correct file based on the platform For example Client httpClient if return if return return IOClient Client httpClient FetchClient import if The correct httpClient will be available Connect the HTTP client to the code that uses it The best way to pass Client to the places that use it is explicitly through arguments For example void main final client httpClient fetchAlbum client In Flutter you can use a one of many state mangement approaches If you depend on code that uses functions or calls the Client constructor then you can use runWithClient to ensure that the correct Client is used When an Isolate is spawned it does not inherit any variables from the calling Zone so runWithClient needs to be used in each Isolate that uses package http You can ensure that only the Client that you have explicitly configured is used by defining in the environment This will also allow the default Client implementation to be removed resulting in a reduced application size flutter build appbundle dart compile exe

Remove data for the key await Multiple instances In order to make preference lookup via the get methods synchronous uses a cache on the Dart side which is normally only updated by the set methods Usually this is an implementation detail that does not affect callers but it can cause issues in a few cases If you are using from multiple isolates since each isolate has its own SharedPreferences singleton and cache If you are using in multiple engine instances including those created by plugins that create background contexts on mobile devices such as If you are modifying the underlying system preference store through something other than the plugin such as native code If you need to read a preference value that may have been changed by anything other than the SharedPreferences instance you are reading it from you should call reload on the instance before reading from it to update its cache with any external changes If this is problematic for your use case you can thumbs up this issue to express interest in APIs that provide direct asynchronous access to the underlying preference store subscribe to it for updates Migration and Prefixes By default the SharedPreferences plugin will only read and write preferences that begin with the prefix flutter This is all handled internally by the plugin and does not require manually adding this prefix Alternatively SharedPreferences can be configured to use any prefix by adding a call to setPrefix before any instances of SharedPreferences are instantiated Calling setPrefix after an instance of SharedPreferences is created will fail Setting the prefix to an empty string will allow access to all preferences created by any versions of the app for migrating from a native app to flutter If the prefix is set to a value such as that causes it to read values that were not originally stored by the SharedPreferences initializing SharedPreferences may fail if any of the values are of types that are not supported by SharedPreferences In this case you can set an allowList that contains only preferences of supported types If you decide to remove the prefix entirely you can still access previously created preferences by manually adding the previous prefix flutter to the beginning of the preference key If you have been using SharedPreferences with the default prefix but wish to change to a new prefix you will need to transform your current preferences manually to add the new prefix otherwise the old preferences will be inaccessible Testing In tests you can replace the standard SharedPreferences

wrapper around InheritedWidget to make them easier to use and more reusable By using provider instead of manually writing InheritedWidget you get simplified of resources a vastly reduced boilerplate over making a new class every time devtool friendly using Provider the state of your application will be visible in the Flutter devtool a common way to consume these InheritedWidgets See increased scalability for classes with a listening mechanism that grows exponentially in complexity such as ChangeNotifier which is O N for dispatching notifications To read more about a provider see its documentation See also The official Flutter state management documentation which showcases how to use provider ChangeNotifier flutter architecture sample which contains an implementation of that app using provider ChangeNotifier and Mobx which uses a provider in their architecture Migration from to initialData for both FutureProvider and StreamProvider is now required To migrate what used to be FutureProvider int create context child MyApp Widget build BuildContext context final value int return Text value is now FutureProvider int initialValue null create context child MyApp Widget build BuildContext context be sure to specify the in watch int final value int return Text value ValueListenableProvider is removed To migrate you can instead use Provider combined with ValueListenableBuilder ValueListenableBuilder int valueListenable myValueListenable builder context value return Provider int value value child MyApp Usage Exposing a value Exposing a new object instance Providers allow you to not only expose a value but also create listen and dispose of it To expose a newly created object use the default constructor of a provider Do not use the constructor if you want to create an object or you may otherwise have undesired side effects See this StackOverflow answer which explains why using the constructor to create values is undesired DO create a new object inside create Provider create MyModel child DO use to create your object value MyModel child DO create your object from variables that can change over time In such a situation your object would never update when the value changes int count Provider create MyModel count child If you want to pass variables that can change over time to your object consider using ProxyProvider int count update MyModel count child NOTE When using the callback of a provider it is worth noting that this callback is called lazily by default This means that until the value is requested at least once the callbacks wo be called This behavior can be disabled if you want to some logic using the lazy parameter MyProvider create Something lazy false Reusing an existing object instance If you already have an object instance and want to expose it it would be best to use the constructor of a provider Failing to do so may call your object dispose method when it is still in use DO use to provide an existing ChangeNotifier MyChangeNotifier variable value variable child DO reuse an existing ChangeNotifier using the default constructor MyChangeNotifier variable ChangeNotifierProvider create variable child Reading a value The easiest way to read a value is by using the extension methods on BuildContext T which makes the widget listen to changes on T T which returns T without listening to it T R R cb T value which allows a widget to listen to only a small part of One can also use the static method T context which will behave similarly to watch When the listen parameter is set to false as in T context listen false then it will behave similarly to read It worth noting that T wo make a widget rebuild when the value changes and it can not be called inside On the other hand it can be freely called outside of these methods These methods will look up in the widget tree starting from the widget associated with the BuildContext passed and will return the nearest variable of type T found or throw if nothing is found This operation is O It does involve walking in the widget tree Combined with the first example of exposing a value this widget will read the exposed String and render Hello World class Home extends StatelessWidget override Widget build BuildContext context return Text Do forget to pass the type of the object you want to obtain to watch String Alternatively instead of using these methods we can use Consumer and Selector These can be useful for performance optimizations or when it is difficult to obtain a BuildContext descendant of the provider See the FAQ or the documentation of Consumer and Selector for more information Optionally depending on a provider Sometimes we may want to support cases where a provider does not exist An example would be for reusable widgets that could be used in various locations including outside of a provider To do so when calling make the generic type nullable Such that instead of Model which will throw a ProviderNotFoundException if no matching providers are found do Model which will try to obtain a matching provider But if none are found null will be returned instead of throwing MultiProvider When injecting many values in big applications Provider can rapidly become pretty nested Provider Something create Something child Provider SomethingElse create SomethingElse child Provider AnotherThing create AnotherThing child someWidget To MultiProvider providers Provider Something create Something Provider SomethingElse create SomethingElse Provider AnotherThing create AnotherThing child someWidget The behavior of both examples is strictly the same MultiProvider only changes the appearance of the code ProxyProvider Since the there is a new kind of provider ProxyProvider ProxyProvider is a provider that combines multiple values from other providers into a new object and sends the result to Provider That new object will then be updated whenever one of the provider we depend on gets updated The following example uses ProxyProvider to build translations based on a counter coming from another provider Widget build BuildContext context return MultiProvider providers ChangeNotifierProvider create Counter ProxyProvider Counter Translations update counter Translations child Foo class Translations const Translations final int String get title clicked times It comes under multiple variations such as ProxyProvider vs vs That digit after the class name is the number of other providers that ProxyProvider depends on ProxyProvider vs ChangeNotifierProxyProvider vs ListenableProxyProvider They all work similarly but instead of sending the result into a Provider a ChangeNotifierProxyProvider will send its value to a ChangeNotifierProvider FAQ Can I inspect the content of my objects Flutter comes with a devtool that shows what the widget tree is at a given moment Since providers are widgets they are also visible in that devtool From there if you click on one provider you will be able to see the value it exposes screenshot of the devtools using the example folder The devtool only shows Instance of MyClass What can I do By default the devtool relies on toString which defaults to Instance of MyClass To have something more useful you have two solutions use the Diagnosticable API from Flutter For most cases I will use DiagnosticableTreeMixin on your objects followed by a custom implementation of debugFillProperties class MyClass with DiagnosticableTreeMixin MyClass final int a final String b override void debugFillProperties DiagnosticPropertiesBuilder properties properties list all the properties of your class here See the documentation of debugFillProperties for more information IntProperty a a StringProperty b b Override toString If you can not use DiagnosticableTreeMixin like if your class is in a package that does not depend on Flutter then you can override toString This is easier than using DiagnosticableTreeMixin but is less powerful You will not be able to the details of your object class MyClass with DiagnosticableTreeMixin MyClass final int a final String b override String toString return runtimeType a a b b I have an exception when obtaining Providers inside initState What can I do This exception happens because you trying to listen to a provider from a that will never ever be called again It means that you either should use another build or explicitly specify that you do not care about updates As such instead of initState print Foo you can do Value value Widget build BuildContext context final value Foo if value value print value which will print value whenever it changes and only when it changes Alternatively you can do initState print Foo Which will print value once and ignore updates How to handle on my objects You can make your provided object implement ReassembleHandler class Example extends ChangeNotifier implements ReassembleHandler override void reassemble print Then used typically with provider ChangeNotifierProvider create Example I use ChangeNotifier and I have an exception when I update it What happens This likely happens because you are modifying the ChangeNotifier from one of its descendants while the widget tree is building A typical situation where this happens is when starting an http request where the future is stored inside the notifier initState MyNotifier This is not allowed because the state update is synchronous This means that some widgets may build before the mutation happens getting an old value while other widgets will build after the mutation is complete getting a new value This could cause inconsistencies in your UI and is therefore not allowed Instead you should perform that mutation in a place that would affect the entire tree equally directly inside the create of your of your model class MyNotifier with ChangeNotifier MyNotifier Future void async This is useful when there no external parameter asynchronously at the end of the frame initState MyNotifier someValue It is slightly less ideal but allows passing parameters to the mutation Do I have to use ChangeNotifier for complex states No You can use any object to represent your state For example an alternate architecture is to use combined with a StatefulWidget Here a counter example using such architecture class Example extends StatefulWidget const Example Key key super key key final Widget child override ExampleState createState ExampleState class ExampleState extends State Example int void increment setState override Widget build BuildContext context return value child value this child where we can read the state by doing return Text int and modify the state with return FloatingActionButton onPressed ExampleState child Icon Alternatively you can create your own provider Can I make my Provider Yes provider exposes all the small components that make a provider This includes SingleChildStatelessWidget to make any widget works with MultiProvider This interface is exposed as part of package InheritedProvider the generic InheritedWidget obtained when doing Here an example of a custom provider to use ValueNotifier as the state https My widget rebuilds too often What can I do Instead of you can use to listen only to the specific set of properties on the obtained object For example while you can write Widget build BuildContext context final person Person return Text It may cause the widget to rebuild if something other than name changes Instead you can use to listen only to the name property Widget build BuildContext context final name Person p return Text name This way the widget wo unnecessarily rebuild if something other than name changes Similarly you can use Their optional child argument allows rebuilding only a particular part of the widget tree Foo child Consumer A builder a child return Bar a a child child child Baz In this example only Bar will rebuild when A updates Foo and Baz unnecessarily rebuild Can I obtain two different providers using the same type No While you can have multiple providers sharing the same type a widget will be able to obtain only one of them the closest ancestor Instead it would help if you explicitly gave both providers a different type Instead of Provider String create child Provider String create child Prefer Provider Country create Country child Provider City create City child Can I consume an interface and provide an implementation Yes a type hint must be given to the compiler to indicate the interface will be consumed with the implementation provided in create abstract class ProviderInterface with ChangeNotifier class ProviderImplementation with ChangeNotifier implements ProviderInterface class Foo extends StatelessWidget override build context final provider ProviderInterface context return ChangeNotifierProvider ProviderInterface create ProviderImplementation child Foo Existing providers provider exposes a few different kinds of provider for different types of objects The complete list of all the objects available is here name description Provider The most basic form of provider It takes a value and exposes it whatever the value is ListenableProvider A specific provider for Listenable object ListenableProvider will listen to the object and ask widgets which depend on it to rebuild whenever the listener is called ChangeNotifierProvider A specification of ListenableProvider for ChangeNotifier It will automatically call when needed ValueListenableProvider Listen to a ValueListenable and only expose StreamProvider Listen to a Stream and expose the latest value emitted FutureProvider Takes a Future and updates dependents when the future completes My application throws a StackOverflowError because I have too many providers what can I do If you have a very large number of providers it is possible that some devices will throw a StackOverflowError because you building too many widgets at once In this situation you have a few solutions If your application has a try mounting your providers over time instead of all at once You could do MultiProvider providers if lots of providers if some more providers where during your splash screen animation you would do bool false bool false override initState Future setState true Future setState true Consider opting out of using MultiProvider MultiProvider works by adding a widget between every providers Not using MultiProvider can increase the limit before a StackOverflowError is reached Sponsors wrapper around InheritedWidget to make

subscribe to the sending progress See all examples code here Dio APIs Creating an instance and set default configs It is recommended to use a singleton of Dio in projects which can manage configurations like headers base urls and timeouts consistently Here is an example that use a singleton in Flutter You can create instance of Dio with an optional BaseOptions object final dio Dio With default Options void configureDio Set default configs Duration seconds Duration seconds Or create Dio with a BaseOptions instance final options BaseOptions baseUrl connectTimeout Duration seconds receiveTimeout Duration seconds final anotherDio Dio options The core API in Dio instance is Future Response T request T String path Object data Map String dynamic queryParameters CancelToken cancelToken Options options ProgressCallback onSendProgress ProgressCallback onReceiveProgress final response await data options Options method Request Options The Options class describes the HTTP request information and configuration Each Dio instance has a base config for all requests made by itself and we can override the base config with Options when make a single request The Options declaration as follows The HTTP request method String method Timeout when sending data Throws the DioException with type when timed out null or means no timeout limit Duration sendTimeout Timeout when receiving data The timeout represents a timeout before the connection is established and the first received response bytes the duration during data transfer of each byte event rather than the total duration of the receiving Throws the DioException with type when timed out null or means no timeout limit Duration receiveTimeout Custom field that you can retrieve it later in Interceptor Transformer and the object Map String dynamic extra HTTP request headers The keys of the header are and will be treated as the same key Map String dynamic headers Whether the case of header keys should be preserved Defaults to false This option WILL NOT take effect on these circumstances XHR HttpRequest does not support handling this explicitly The standard only supports lowercase header keys bool preserveHeaderCase The type of data that Dio handles with options The default value is Dio will parse response string to JSON object automatically when the of response is See also plain if you want to receive the data as String bytes if you want to receive the data as the complete bytes stream if you want to receive the data as streamed binary bytes ResponseType responseType The request The default for requests will be implied by the ImplyContentTypeInterceptor according to the type of the request payload The interceptor can be removed by String contentType Defines whether the request is considered to be successful with the given status code The request will be treated as succeed if the callback returns true ValidateStatus validateStatus Whether to retrieve the data if status code indicates a failed request Defaults to true bool receiveDataWhenStatusError See Defaults to true bool followRedirects The maximum number of redirects when followRedirects is true RedirectException will be thrown if redirects exceeded the limit Defaults to int maxRedirects See Defaults to true bool persistentConnection The default request encoder is you can set custom encoder by this option RequestEncoder requestEncoder The default response decoder is you can set custom decoder by this option it will be used in Transformer ResponseDecoder responseDecoder Indicates the format of collection data in request query parameters and body data Defaults to ListFormat listFormat There is a complete example here Response The response for a request contains the following information Response body may have been transformed please refer to ResponseType T data The corresponding request info RequestOptions requestOptions HTTP status code int statusCode Returns the reason phrase associated with the status code The reason phrase must be set before the body is written to Setting the reason phrase after writing to the body String statusMessage Whether this response is a redirect Attention Whether this field is available depends on whether the implementation of the adapter supports it or not bool isRedirect The series of redirects this connection has been through The list will be empty if no redirects were followed redirects will be updated both in the case of an automatic and a manual redirect Attention Whether this field is available depends on whether the implementation of the adapter supports it or not List RedirectRecord redirects Custom fields that only for the Response Map String dynamic extra Response headers Headers headers When request is succeed you will receive the response as follows final response await print print print print Be aware the is different from they are not related to each other Interceptors For each dio instance we can add one or more interceptors by which we can intercept requests responses and errors before they are handled by then or catchError InterceptorsWrapper onRequest RequestOptions options RequestInterceptorHandler handler Do something before request is sent If you want to resolve the request with custom data you can resolve a Response using response If you want to reject the request with a error message you can reject with a DioException using dioError return options onResponse Response response ResponseInterceptorHandler handler Do something with response data If you want to reject the request with a error message you can reject a DioException object using dioError return response onError DioException error ErrorInterceptorHandler handler Do something with response error If you want to resolve the request with some custom data you can resolve a Response object using response return error Simple interceptor example import class CustomInterceptors extends Interceptor override void onRequest RequestOptions options RequestInterceptorHandler handler print PATH options handler override void onResponse Response response ResponseInterceptorHandler handler print PATH response handler override Future onError DioException err ErrorInterceptorHandler handler async print PATH err handler Resolve and reject the request In all interceptors you can interfere with their execution flow If you want to resolve the with some custom data you can call Response If you want to reject the with a error message you can call dioError InterceptorsWrapper onRequest options handler return Response requestOptions options data data final response await print QueuedInterceptor Interceptor can be executed concurrently that is all the requests enter the interceptor at once rather than executing sequentially However in some cases we expect that requests enter the interceptor sequentially like Therefore we need to provide a mechanism for sequential access step by step to interceptors and QueuedInterceptor can solve this problem Example Because of security reasons we need all the requests to set up a csrfToken in the header if csrfToken does not exist we need to request a csrfToken first and then perform the network request because the request csrfToken progress is asynchronous so we need to execute this async request in request interceptor For the complete code see here LogInterceptor You can apply the LogInterceptor to log requests and responses automatically Note LogInterceptor should always be the last interceptor added otherwise modifications by following interceptors will not be logged Dart LogInterceptor responseBody false Do not output responses body Note When using the default logPrint function logs will only be printed in DEBUG mode when the assertion is enabled Alternatively dart developer log can also be used to log messages available in Flutter too Flutter When using Flutter Flutters own debugPrint function should be used This ensures that debug messages are also available via flutter logs Note debugPrint does not mean print logs under the DEBUG mode it a throttled function which helps to print full logs without truncation Do not use it under any production environment unless you intended to LogInterceptor logPrint o debugPrint Custom Interceptor You can customize interceptor by extending the class There is an example that implementing a simple cache policy custom cache interceptor Handling Errors When an error occurs Dio will wrap the to a DioException try await on DioException catch e The request was made and the server responded with a status code that falls out of the range of and is also not if null print print print else Something happened in setting up or sending the request that triggered an Error print print DioException The request info for the request that throws exception RequestOptions requestOptions Response info it may be null if the request ca reach to the HTTP server for example occurring a DNS error network is not available Response response The type of the current DioException DioExceptionType type The original object It usually not null when type is Object error The stacktrace of the original object It usually not null when type is StackTrace stackTrace The error message that throws a DioException String message DioExceptionType See the source code Using format By default Dio serializes request data except String type to JSON To send data in the format instead Instance level or only works once data options Options contentType Sending FormData You can also send FormData with Dio which will send data in the and it supports uploading files final formData await filename final response await data formData You can also specify your desired boundary name which will be used to construct boundaries of every FormData with additional prefix and suffix final formDataWithBoundaryName FormData boundaryName FormData is supported with the POST method typically There is a complete example here Multiple files upload There are two ways to add multiple files to FormData the only difference is that upload keys are different for array final formData filename filename The upload key eventually becomes files This is because many services add a middle bracket to key when they get an array of files If you do want a list literal you should create FormData as follows Do use final formData FormData MapEntry filename MapEntry filename Reuse FormDatas and MultipartFiles You should make a new FormData or MultipartFile every time in repeated requests A typical wrong behavior is setting the FormData as a variable and using it in every request It can be easy for the Can not finalize exceptions to occur To avoid that write your requests like the below code Future void async Future FormData createFormData async return await filename await data await createFormData Transformer Transformer allows changes to the data before it is the server This is only applicable for request methods and Dio has already implemented a DefaultTransformer as default If you want to customize the transformation of data you can provide a Transformer by your self and replace the DefaultTransformer by setting the only takes effect when request with they methods that can contain the request body however can be applied to all types of responses In Flutter If you using Dio in Flutter development it better to decode JSON in isolates with the compute function Must be function Map String dynamic String response return jsonDecode response as Map String dynamic Future Map String dynamic parseJson String text return compute text void main Custom jsonDecodeCallback DefaultTransformer jsonDecodeCallback parseJson runApp MyApp Other example There is an example for customizing Transformer HttpClientAdapter HttpClientAdapter is a bridge between Dio and HttpClient Dio implements standard and friendly APIs for developer HttpClient is the real object that makes Http requests We can use any HttpClient not just dart io HttpClient to make HTTP requests And all we need is providing a HttpClientAdapter The default HttpClientAdapter for Dio is IOHttpClientAdapter on native platforms and BrowserHttpClientAdapter on the Web platform They can be initiated by calling the HttpClientAdapter HttpClientAdapter If you want to use platform adapters explicitly For the Web platform import BrowserHttpClientAdapter For native platforms import IOHttpClientAdapter Here is a simple example to custom adapter Using proxy IOHttpClientAdapter provide a callback to set proxy to dart io HttpClient for example import void initAdapter IOHttpClientAdapter createHttpClient final client HttpClient Config the client uri Forward all request to proxy Be aware the proxy should went through you running device not the host platform return You can also create a new HttpClient for Dio instead of returning but a client must being returned here return client There is a complete example here Web does not support to set proxy HTTPS certificate verification HTTPS certificate verification or public key pinning refers to the process of ensuring that the certificates protecting the TLS connection to the server are the ones you expect them to be The intention is to reduce the chance of a attack The theory is covered by OWASP Server Response Certificate Unlike other methods this one works with the certificate of the server itself void initAdapter const String fingerprint IOHttpClientAdapter createHttpClient Do trust any certificate just because their root cert is trusted final HttpClient client HttpClient context SecurityContext withTrustedRoots false You can test the intermediate root cert here We just ignore it cert host port true return client validateCertificate cert host port Check that the cert fingerprint matches the one we expect We definitely require certificate if cert null return false Validate it any way you want Here we only check that the fingerprint matches the OpenSSL return fingerprint You can use openssl to read the value of a certificate openssl openssl DF AB AD remove the formatting keep only lower case hex characters to match the above Certificate Authority Verification These methods work well when your server has a certificate but they do work for certificates issued by a party like AWS or Let Encrypt There are two ways to verify the root of the https certificate chain provided by the server Suppose the certificate format is PEM the code like void initAdapter String PEM root certificate content IOHttpClientAdapter createHttpClient final client HttpClient cert String host int port return PEM Verify the certificate return client Another way is creating a SecurityContext when create the HttpClient void initAdapter String PEM root certificate content IOHttpClientAdapter onHttpClientCreate final SecurityContext sc SecurityContext File pathToTheCertificate final HttpClient client HttpClient context sc return client In this way the format of setTrustedCertificates must be PEM or requires password to use which will expose the password in the code so it not recommended to use in common cases support is a Dio HttpClientAdapter which supports Cancellation You can cancel a request using a CancelToken One token can be shared with multiple requests When a token cancel is invoked all requests with this token will be cancelled final cancelToken CancelToken url cancelToken cancelToken DioException error if error print canceled else handle Cancel the requests with cancelled message There is a complete example here Extends Dio class Dio is an abstract class with factory constructor so we do extend Dio class direct We can extend DioForNative or DioForBrowser instead for example import import If in browser import class Http extends DioForNative Http BaseOptions options super options do something We can also implement a custom Dio client class MyDio with DioMixin implements Dio Resource Sharing on Web CORS If a request is not a simple request the Web browser will send a CORS preflight request that checks to see if the CORS protocol is understood and a server is aware using specific methods and headers You can modify your requests to match the definition of simple request or add a CORS middleware for your service to handle CORS requests powerful HTTP networking package supports

app settings so users can grant permission On Android you can show a rationale for requesting permission See the FAQ section for more information on common questions when using the plugin Setup While the permissions are being requested during runtime you still need to tell the OS which permissions your app might potentially use That requires adding permission configuration to Android and files Android click to expand Upgrade Android projects Since version this plugin is implemented using the Flutter Android plugin APIs Unfortunately this means App developers also need to migrate their Apps to support the new Android infrastructure You can do so by following the Upgrading pre Android projects migration guide Failing to do so might result in unexpected behavior The most common known error is the not returning after calling the method on permission AndroidX As of version the plugin switched to the AndroidX version of the Android Support Libraries This means you need to make sure your Android project is also upgraded to support AndroidX Detailed instructions can be found here The TL DR version is Add the following to your file Make sure you set the compileSdkVersion in your file to android compileSdkVersion Make sure you replace all the android dependencies to their AndroidX counterparts a full list can be found here Add permissions to your file There are debug main and profile versions which are chosen depending on how you start your app In general it sufficient to add permission only to the main version Here an example with a complete list of all possible permissions iOS click to expand Add permission to your file Here an example with a complete list of all possible permissions IMPORTANT You will have to include all permission options when you want to submit your App This is because the plugin touches all different SDKs and because the static code analyzer run by Apple upon App submission detects this and will assert if it can not find a matching permission option in the More information about this can be found here The plugin use macros to control whether a permission is enabled You must list the permission you want to use in your application Add the following to your Podfile file do do target do You can remove unused permissions here for more information https when you do need camera permission just add inherited dart dart dart dart dart dart dart dart The macro enables the locationWhenInUse and locationAlways permission If the application only requires locationWhenInUse only specify the macro dart dart dart dart dart dart dart dart end end end Remove

to the Android and permissions Starting from Android API the and permissions have been marked deprecated and have been fully since Android API If your application needs access to media files Google recommends using the or permissions instead These can be requested using the and respectively To request these permissions make sure the compileSdkVersion in the file is set to If your application needs access to Android file system it is possible to request the permission using As of Android API the permission is considered a or sensitive permission Therefore it is required to declare the use of these permissions if you intend to release the application via the Google Play Store Requesting always returns denied on Android API What can I do Starting with Android apps are required to first obtain permission to read the device location in the foreground before requesting to read the location in the background as well When requesting the always permission directly or when requesting both permissions at the same time the system will ignore the request So instead of calling only make sure to first call either or and obtain permission to read the GPS Once you obtain this permission you can call This will present the user with the option to update the settings so the location can always be read in the background For more information visit the Android documentation on requesting location permissions Checking or requesting a permission terminates the application on iOS What can I do First of all make sure all that the file contains entries for all the permissions the application requires If an entry is missing iOS will terminate the application as soon as the particular permission is being checked or requested If the application requires access to SiriKit by requesting the permission also make sure to add the entitlement to the application configuration To do so create a file if it does exists already called in the folder that is part of the project Open the file and add the following contents xml DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC PLIST http plist dict key The important part here is the key with value and the element It is possible that this file also contains other entitlements depending on the needs of the application Issues Please file any issues bugs or feature requests as an issue on our GitHub page Commercial support is available if you need help with

layer Notice that the CounterPage widget knows nothing about what happens when a user taps the buttons The widget simply notifies the CounterCubit that the user has pressed either the increment or decrement button Bloc Widgets BlocBuilder BlocBuilder is a Flutter widget which requires a bloc and a builder function BlocBuilder handles building the widget in response to new states BlocBuilder is very similar to StreamBuilder but has a more simple API to reduce the amount of boilerplate code needed The builder function will potentially be called many times and should be a pure function that returns a widget in response to the state See BlocListener if you want to do anything in response to state changes such as navigation showing a dialog etc If the bloc parameter is omitted BlocBuilder will automatically perform a lookup using BlocProvider and the current BuildContext BlocBuilder BlocA BlocAState builder context state return widget here based on BlocA state Only specify the bloc if you wish to provide a bloc that will be scoped to a single widget and is accessible via a parent BlocProvider and the current BuildContext BlocBuilder BlocA BlocAState bloc blocA provide the local bloc instance builder context state return widget here based on BlocA state For control over when the builder function is called an optional buildWhen can be provided buildWhen takes the previous bloc

state and no rebuild will occur BlocBuilder BlocA BlocAState buildWhen previousState state return to determine whether or not to rebuild the widget with state builder context state return widget here based on BlocA state BlocSelector BlocSelector is a Flutter widget which is analogous to BlocBuilder but allows developers to filter updates by selecting a new value based on the current bloc state Unnecessary builds are prevented if the selected value does not change The selected value must be immutable in order for BlocSelector to accurately determine whether builder should be called again If the bloc parameter is omitted BlocSelector will automatically perform a lookup using BlocProvider and the current BuildContext BlocSelector BlocA BlocAState SelectedState selector state return selected state based on the provided state builder context state return widget here based on the selected state BlocProvider BlocProvider is a Flutter widget which provides a bloc to its children via T context It is used as a dependency injection DI widget so that a single instance of a bloc can be provided to multiple widgets within a subtree In most cases BlocProvider should be used to create new blocs which will be made available to the rest of the subtree In this case since BlocProvider is responsible for creating the bloc it will automatically handle closing it BlocProvider create BuildContext context BlocA child ChildA By default BlocProvider will create the bloc lazily meaning create will get executed when the bloc is looked up via BlocA context To override this behavior and force create to be run immediately lazy can be set to false BlocProvider lazy false create BuildContext context BlocA child ChildA In some cases BlocProvider can be used to provide an existing bloc to a new portion of the widget tree This will be most commonly used when an existing bloc needs to be made available to a new route In this case BlocProvider will not automatically close the bloc since it did not create it value BlocA context child ScreenA then from either ChildA or ScreenA we can retrieve BlocA with with extensions BlocA without extensions BlocA context The above snippets result in a one time lookup and the widget will not be notified of changes To retrieve the instance and subscribe to subsequent state changes use with extensions BlocA without extensions BlocA context listen

a Flutter widget which takes a BlocWidgetListener and an optional bloc and invokes the listener in response to state changes in the bloc It should be used for functionality that needs to occur once per state change such as navigation showing a SnackBar showing a Dialog etc listener is only called once for each state change NOT including the initial state unlike builder in BlocBuilder and is a

Features Get the last known location Get the current location of the device Get continuous location updates Check if location services are enabled on the device Calculate the distance in meters between two geocoordinates Calculate the bearing between two geocoordinates IMPORTANT Version of the geolocator plugin contains several breaking changes for a complete overview please have a look at the Breaking changes in wiki page Starting from version the geocoding features placemarkFromAddress and placemarkFromCoordinates are no longer part of the geolocator plugin We have moved these features to their own plugin geocoding This new plugin is an improved version of the old methods Usage To add the geolocator to your Flutter application read the install instructions Below are some Android and iOS specifics that are required for the geolocator to work correctly Android Upgrade pre Android projects Since version this plugin is implemented using the Flutter Android plugin APIs Unfortunately this means App developers also need to migrate their Apps to support the new Android infrastructure You can do so by following the Upgrading pre Android projects migration guide Failing to do so might result in unexpected behaviour AndroidX The geolocator plugin requires the AndroidX version of the Android Support Libraries This means you need to make sure your Android project supports AndroidX Detailed instructions can be found here The TL DR version is Add the following to your file Make sure you set the compileSdkVersion in your file to android compileSdkVersion Make sure you replace all the android dependencies to their AndroidX counterparts a full list can be found here Migrating to AndroidX Permissions On Android you need to add either the or the permission to your Android Manifest To do so open the file located under and add one of the following two lines as direct children of the manifest tag when you configure both permissions the will be used by the geolocator plugin android android Starting from Android you need to add the permission next to the or the permission if you want to continue receiving updates even when your App is running in the background note that the geolocator plugin does support receiving and processing location updates while running in the background android NOTE Specifying the permission results in location updates with an accuracy approximately equivalent to a city block It might take a long time minutes before you will get your first locations fix as will only use the network services to calculate the position of the device More information can be found here iOS On iOS you need to add the following entry to your file located under in order to access the device location Simply open your file and add the following make sure you update the description so it is meaningfull in the context of your App key NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription string This app needs access to location when If you do need to receive updates when your app is in the background then add a compiler flag as follows in XCode click on Pods choose the Target choose Build Settings in the search box look for Macros then add the flag Setting this flag prevents your app from requiring the NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription entry in and avoids questions from Apple when submitting your app You can also have the flag set automatically by adding the following to the of your application do do if do inherited end end end end If you do want to receive updates when your App is in the background or if you do bypass the permission request as described above then you need to Add the Background Modes capability to your XCode project Project Signing and Capabilities Capability button and select Location Updates Be careful with this you will need to explain in detail to Apple why your App needs this when submitting your App to the AppStore If Apple is satisfied with the explanation your App will be rejected Add an NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription entry to your use NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription if you targeting iOS When using the requestTemporaryFullAccuracy purposeKey YourPurposeKey method a dictionary should be added to the file key NSLocationTemporaryUsageDescriptionDictionary dict key YourPurposeKey string The example App requires temporary access to the device apos s precise The second key in this example called YourPurposeKey should match the purposeKey that is passed in the requestTemporaryFullAccuracy method It is possible to define multiple keys for different features in your app More information can be found in Apple documentation NOTE the first time requesting temporary full accuracy access it might take several seconds for the to show This is due to the fact that iOS is determining the exact user location which may take several seconds Unfortunately this is out of our hands macOS On macOS you need to add the following entries to your file located under in order to access the device location Simply open your file and add the following make sure you update the description so it is meaningfull in the context of your App key NSLocationUsageDescription string This app needs access to You will also have to add the following entry to the and files This will declare that your App wants to make use of the device location services and adds it to the list in the System Preferences Security Privace Privacy settings key When using the requestTemporaryFullAccuracy purposeKey YourPurposeKey method a dictionary should be added to the file key NSLocationTemporaryUsageDescriptionDictionary dict key YourPurposeKey string The example App requires temporary access to the device apos s precise The second key in this example called YourPurposeKey should match the purposeKey that is passed in the requestTemporaryFullAccuracy method It is possible to define multiple keys for different features in your app More information can be found in Apple documentation NOTE the first time requesting temporary full accuracy access it might take several seconds for the to show This is due to the fact that macOS is determining the exact user location which may take several seconds Unfortunately this is out of our hands Web To use the Geolocator plugin on the web you need to be using Flutter or higher Flutter will automatically add the endorsed package to your application when you add the geolocator dependency to your The following methods of the geolocator API are not supported on the web and will result in a UnsupportedError

requesting permission to access the position of the device import Determine the current position of the device When the location services are not enabled or permissions are denied the Future will return an error Future Position async bool serviceEnabled LocationPermission permission Test if location services are enabled serviceEnabled await if serviceEnabled Location services are not enabled do continue accessing the position and request users of the App to enable the location services return services are disabled permission await if permission permission await if permission Permissions are denied next time you could try requesting permissions again this is also where Android shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale returned true According to Android guidelines your App should show an explanatory UI now return permissions are denied if permission Permissions are denied forever handle appropriately return permissions are permanently denied we can not request permissions When we reach here permissions are granted and we can continue accessing the position of the device return await API Geolocation Current location To query the current location of the device simply make a call to the getCurrentPosition method You can finetune the results by specifying the following parameters desiredAccuracy the accuracy of the location data that your app wants to receive timeLimit the maximum amount of time allowed to acquire the current location When the time limit is passed a TimeOutException will be thrown and the call will be cancelled By default no limit is configured import Position position await desiredAccuracy Last known location To query the last known location retrieved stored on the device you can use the getLastKnownPosition method note that this can result in a null value when no location details are available import Position position await Listen to location updates To listen for location changes you can call the getPositionStream to receive stream you can listen to and receive position updates You can finetune the results by specifying the following parameters accuracy the accuracy of the location data that your app wants to receive distanceFilter the minimum distance measured in meters a device must move horizontally before an update event is generated timeLimit the maximum amount of time allowed between location updates When the time limit is passed a TimeOutException will be thrown and the stream will be cancelled By default no limit is configured import final LocationSettings locationSettings LocationSettings accuracy distanceFilter StreamSubscription Position positionStream locationSettings locationSettings Position position print position null In certain situation it is necessary to specify some platform specific settings This can be accomplished using the platform specific AndroidSettings or AppleSettings classes When using a platform specific class the platform specific package must be imported as well For example import import import late LocationSettings locationSettings if defaultTargetPlatform locationSettings AndroidSettings accuracy distanceFilter forceLocationManager true intervalDuration const Duration seconds Optional Set foreground notification config to keep the app alive going to the background foregroundNotificationConfig const ForegroundNotificationConfig notificationText Example app will continue to

activityType distanceFilter pauseLocationUpdatesAutomatically true Only set to true if our app will be started up in the background showBackgroundLocationIndicator false else locationSettings LocationSettings accuracy distanceFilter StreamSubscription Position positionStream locationSettings locationSettings Position position print position null Location accuracy Android and iOS only To query if a user enabled Approximate location fetching or Precise location fetching you can call the Geolocator method This will return a Future LocationAccuracyStatus which when completed contains a if the user has enabled Approximate location fetching or if the user has enabled Precise location fetching When calling getLocationAccuracy before the user has given permission the method will return by default On iOS or below the method getLocationAccuracy will always return since that is the default value for iOS and below import var accuracy await Location service information To check if location services are enabled you can call the isLocationServiceEnabled method import bool isLocationServiceEnabled await To listen for service status changes you can call the getServiceStatusStream This will return a Stream ServiceStatus which can be listened to to receive location service status updates import StreamSubscription ServiceStatus serviceStatusStream ServiceStatus status print status Permissions When using the web platform the checkPermission method will return the status when the browser does support the JavaScript Permissions API Nevertheless the getCurrentPosition and getPositionStream methods can still be used on the web platform If you want to check if the user already granted permissions to acquire the device location you can make a call to the checkPermission method import LocationPermission permission await If you want to request permission to access the device location you can call the requestPermission method import LocationPermission permission await Possible results from the checkPermission and requestPermission methods are Permission Description denied Permission to access the device location is denied by the user You are free to request permission again this is also the initial permission state deniedForever Permission to access the device location is permanently denied When requesting permissions the permission dialog will not be shown until the user updates the permission in the App settings whileInUse Permission to access the device location is allowed only while the App is in use always Permission to access the device location is allowed even when the App is running in the background Note Android can only return whileInUse always or denied when checking permissions Due to limitations on the Android OS it is not possible to determine if permissions are denied permanently when checking permissions Using a workaround the geolocator is only able to do so as a result of the requestPermission method More information can be found in our wiki Settings In some cases it is necessary to ask the user and update their device settings For example when the user initially permanently denied permissions to access the device location or if the location services are not enabled and on Android automatic resolution did work In these cases you can use the openAppSettings or openLocationSettings methods to immediately redirect the user to the device settings page On Android the openAppSettings method will redirect the user to the App specific settings where the user can update necessary permissions The openLocationSettings method will redirect the user to the location settings where the user can disable the location services On iOS we are not allowed to open specific setting pages so both methods will redirect the user to the Settings App from where the user can navigate to the correct settings category to update permissions or disable the location services import await await Utility methods To calculate the distance in meters between two geocoordinates you can use the distanceBetween method The distanceBetween method takes four parameters Parameter Type Description startLatitude double Latitude of the start position startLongitude double Longitude of the start position endLatitude double Latitude of the destination position endLongitude double Longitude of the destination position import double distanceInMeters If you want to calculate the bearing between two geocoordinates you can use the bearingBetween method The bearingBetween method also takes four parameters Parameter Type Description startLatitude double Latitude of the start position startLongitude double Longitude of the start position endLatitude double Latitude of the destination position endLongitude double Longitude of the destination position import double bearing Location accuracy Android On Android the LocationAccuracy enum controls the accuracy of the location data the app wants to receive It also provides control over the priority given to the location stream This can be confusing as a priority of lowest might not return any location while one might expect it to give the quickest responses The table below outlines the priority and its meaning per accuracy option Location accuracy Android priority Description lowest Ensures that no extra power will be used to derive locations This enforces that the request will act as a passive listener that will only receive free locations calculated on behalf of other clients and no locations will be calculated on behalf of only this request low Requests a tradeoff that favors low power usage at the possible expense of location accuracy medium Requests a tradeoff that is balanced between location accuracy and power usage Requests a tradeoff that favors highly accurate locations at the possible expense of additional power usage iOS On iOS the LocationAccuracy enum controls the accuracy of the location data the app wants to receive It also provides control on the battery consumption of the device the more detailed data is requested the larger the impact on the battery consumption More details can be found on Apple documentation The table below shows how the LocationAccuracy values map to the native iOS accuracy settings Location accuracy iOS accuracy Description lowest kCLLocationAccuracyThreeKilometers Accurate to the nearest three kilometers low kCLLocationAccuracyKilometer Accurate to the nearest kilometer medium kCLLocationAccuracyHundredMeters Accurate to within one hundred meters high kCLLocationAccuracyNearestTenMeters Accurate to within ten meters of the desired target best kCLLocationAccuracyBest The best level of accuracy available bestForNavigation kCLLocationAccuracyBestForNavigation The highest possible accuracy that uses additional sensor data to facilitate navigation apps Issues Please file any issues bugs or feature requests as an issue on

Flutter default white native splash screen with background color and splash image Supports dark mode full screen and ReadmeChangelogExampleInstallingVersionsScoresWhen your app is opened there is a brief time while the native app loads Flutter By default during this time the native app displays a white splash screen This package automatically generates iOS Android and code for customizing this native splash screen background color and splash image Supports dark mode full screen and options What New Support for GIF images in web You can now keep the splash screen up while your app initializes No need for a secondary splash screen anymore Just use the preserve and remove methods together to remove the splash screen after your initialization is complete See details below Usage Would you prefer a video tutorial instead Check out Johannes Milke tutorial First add as a dependency in your file dependencies Do forget to flutter pub get Setting the splash screen Customize the following settings and add to your project file or place in a new file in your root project folder named This package generates native code to customize Flutter default white native splash screen with background color and splash image Customize the parameters below and run the following command in the terminal dart run create To restore Flutter default white splash screen run the following command in the terminal dart run remove IMPORTANT NOTE These parameter do not affect the configuration of Android and later which handle splash screens differently that prior versions of Android Android and later must be configured specifically in the section below color or is the only required parameter Use color to set the background of your splash screen to a solid color Use to set the background of your splash screen to a png image This is useful for gradients The image will be stretch to the size of the app Only one parameter can be used color and can not both be set color Optional parameters are listed below To enable a parameter uncomment the line by removing the leading character The image parameter allows you to specify an image used in the splash screen It must be a png file and should be sized for pixel density image The branding property allows you to specify an image used as branding in the splash screen It must be a png file It is supported for Android iOS and the Web For Android see the Android section below branding To position the branding image at the bottom of the screen you can use bottom bottomRight and bottomLeft The default values is bottom if not specified or specified something else bottom The are parameters that set the background and image when the device is in dark mode If they are not specified the app will use the parameters from above If the parameter is specified or must be specified and can not both be set From Android onwards the splash screen is handled differently than in previous versions Please visit https Following are specific parameters for Android The image parameter sets the splash screen icon image If this parameter is not specified the app launcher icon will be used instead Please note that the splash screen will be clipped to a circle on the center of the screen App icon with an icon background This should be pixels and fit within a circle pixels in diameter App icon without an icon background This should be pixels and fit within a circle pixels in diameter image Splash screen background color color App icon background color The branding property allows you to specify an image used as branding in the splash screen branding The and set values that apply when the device is in dark mode If they are not specified the app will use the parameters from above eeeeee The android ios and web parameters can be used to disable generating a splash screen on a given platform android false ios false web false Platform specific images can be specified with the following parameters which will override the respective parameter You may specify all selected or none of these parameters The position of the splash image can be set with and parameters All default to center can be one of the following Android

will not automatically show the notification bar when the app loads To show the notification bar add the following code to your Flutter app overlays fullscreen true If you have changed the name s of your file s you can specify the filename s with the parameter Remove only the characters in the three lines below do not remove any spaces Run the package After adding your settings to run the following command in the terminal dart run create When the package finishes running your splash screen is ready Optionally If you added your config to a separate YAML file instead of just add path with the command in the terminal dart run create Set up app initialization optional By default the splash screen will be removed when Flutter has drawn the first frame If you would like the splash screen to remain while your app initializes you can use the preserve and remove methods together Pass the preserve method the value returned from to keep the splash on screen Later when your app has initialized make a call to remove to remove the splash screen import void main WidgetsBinding widgetsBinding widgetsBinding widgetsBinding runApp const MyApp whenever your initialization is completed remove the splash screen NOTE If you do not need to use the preserve and remove methods you can place the dependency in the section of Support the package optional If you find this package useful you can support it for free by giving it a thumbs up at the top of this page Here another option to support the package Android Support Android has a new method of adding splash screens which consists of a window background icon and the icon background Note that a background image is not supported Be aware of the following considerations regarding these elements image parameter By default the launcher icon is used App icon without an icon background as shown on the left This should be pixels and fit within a circle pixels in diameter App icon with an icon background as shown on the right This should be pixels and fit within a circle pixels in diameter is optional and is useful if you need more contrast between the icon and the window background of the foreground is masked color the window background consists of a single opaque color PLEASE NOTE The splash screen may not appear when you launch the app from Android Studio on API However it should appear when you launch by clicking on the launch icon in Android This seems to be resolved in API PLEASE NOTE There are a number of reports that launchers do not display the launch image correctly If the launch image does not display correctly please try the Google launcher to confirm that this package is working PLEASE NOTE The splash screen does not appear when you launch the app from a notification Apparently this is the intended behavior on Android Icon not shown when cold launched from notification Flavor Support If you have a project setup that contains multiple flavors or environments and you created more than one flavor this would be a feature for you Instead of maintaining multiple files and images you can now using this tool create different splash screens for different environments In order to use the new feature and generate the desired splash images for you app a couple of changes are required If you want to generate just one flavor and one file you would use either options as described in Step But in order to setup the flavors you will then be required to move all your setup values to the file but with a prefix Let assume for the rest of the setup that you have different flavors Production Acceptance Development First this you will need to do is to create a different setup file for all flavors with a suffix like so You would setup those files the same way as you would the one but with different assets depending on which environment you would be generating For example Note these are just examples you can use whatever setup you need for your project that is already supported by the package color ffffff image branding image ffffff web false color ffffff image branding image ffffff web false color ffffff image branding image ffffff web false If you like to generate only a single flavor maybe you are testing something out you can use only the single command like this If you have a flavor called production you would do this dart run create flavor production For a flavor with a name staging you would provide it name like so dart run create flavor acceptance And if you have a local version for devs you could do that dart run create flavor development You also have the ability to specify all the flavors in one command as shown bellow dart run create flavors development staging production Note the available flavors need to be comma separated for this option to work Android setup You done No really Android does need any additional setup Note If it did work please make sure that your flavors are named the same as your config files otherwise the setup will not work iOS setup iOS is a bit tricky so hang tight it might look scary but most of the steps are just a single click explained as much as possible to lower the possibility of mistakes When you run the new command you will need to open xCode and follow the steps bellow Assumption In order for this setup to work you would already have different schemes setup production acceptance and development Preparation Open the iOS Flutter project in Xcode open the Find the newly created Storyboard files at the same location where the original is project root Select all of them and drag and drop into Xcode directly to the left hand side where the current is located already After you drop your files there Xcode will ask you to link them make sure you select if This part is done you have linked the newly created storyboards in your project xCode Xcode still does know how to use them so we need to specify for all the current flavors schemes which file to use and to use that value inside the file Open the iOS Flutter project in Xcode open the Click the Runner project in the top left corner usually the first item in the list In the middle part of the screen on the left side select the Runner target On the top part of the screen select Build Settings Make sure that and are selected Next to you have a button press it and select Once you do that Xcode will create a new variable for you to name Suggestion is to name it Once you do that you will have the option to define a specific name for each flavor scheme that you have defined in the project Make sure that you input the exact name of the that was created by this tool Example If you have a flavor Development there is a Storyboard created name please add that name without the storyboard part to the variable value next to the flavor value After you finish with that you need to update file to link the newly created variable so that it used correctly Open the file Find the entry called screen interface file base The default value is change that to the variable name that you create previously If you follow these steps exactly it would be so input this And your done Congrats you finished your setup for multiple flavors FAQs I got the error not found You may need to run the pod install command in your app ios folder I got the error A splash screen was provided to Flutter but this is deprecated This message is not related to this package but is related to a change in how Flutter handles splash screens in Flutter It is caused by having the following code in your which was included by default in previous versions of Flutter android android The solution is to remove the above code Note that this will also remove the fade effect between the native splash screen and your app Are images supported GIFs are now supported on web Lotties are not yet supported PRs are always welcome I got the error AAPT error style attribute not found This attribute was added in Android so if you are getting this error it means your project is not fully set up for Android Did you update your app build configuration I see a flash of the wrong splash screen on iOS This is caused by an iOS splash caching bug which can be solved by uninstalling your app powering off your device power back on and then try reinstalling I see a white screen between splash screen and app It may be caused by an iOS splash caching bug which can be solved by uninstalling your app powering off your device power back on and then try reinstalling It may be caused by the delay due to initialization in your app To solve this use the preserve and remove calls to keep the splash on screen while your app initializes Can I base mode on app settings No This package creates a splash screen that is displayed before Flutter is loaded Because of this when the splash screen loads internal app settings are not available to the splash screen Unfortunately this means that it is impossible to control settings of the splash from app settings Notes If the splash screen was not updated correctly on iOS or if you experience a white screen before the splash screen run flutter clean and recompile your app If that does not solve the problem delete your app power down the device power up the device install and launch the app as per this StackOverflow thread This package modifies and files on Android and on iOS and on Web If you have modified these

Font Awesome Icon pack available as Flutter Icons Provides additional icons to use in your The free Font Awesome Icon pack available as set of Flutter Icons based on font awesome version This icon pack includes only the free icons offered by Font Awesome If you have purchased the pro icons and want to enable support for them please see the instructions below Installation In the dependencies section of your add the following line dependencies Usage import class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget Widget build BuildContext context return IconButton Use the FaIcon Widget FontAwesomeIcons class for the IconData icon FaIcon onPressed print Pressed Icon names Icon names equal those on the official website but are written in lower camel case If more than one icon style is available for an icon the style name is used as prefix except for regular Due to restrictions in dart icons starting with numbers have those numbers written out Examples Icon name Code Style solid this icon does not have other free styles regular solid solid Example App View the Flutter app in the example directory to see all the available FontAwesomeIcons Customizing font awesome flutter We supply a configurator tool to assist you with common customizations to this package All options are interoperable By default if run without arguments and no in exists it updates all icons to the newest free version of font awesome Setup To use your custom version you must first clone this repository to a location of your choice and run flutter pub get inside This installs all dependencies The configurator is located in the util folder and can be started by running on Windows or on linux and mac All following examples use the version but work same for If on windows omit the or replace it with An overview of available options can be viewed with help To use your customized version in an app go to the app and add a dependency for Then override the dependency location dependencies path Enable pro icons By importing pro icons you acknowledge that it is your obligation to keep these files private This includes not uploading your package to a public github repository or other public file sharing services Go to the location of your custom version see setup Download the web version of font awesome pro and open it Move all files from the webfonts directory and from metadata to Replace existing files Run the configurator It should say Custom found It may be required to run flutter clean in apps who use this version for changes to appear Excluding styles One or more styles can be excluded from all generation processes by passing them with the exclude option exclude solid exclude solid brands See the optimizations and dynamic icon retrieval by name sections for more information as to why it makes sense for your app Retrieve icons dynamically by their name or css class Probably the most requested feature after support for pro icons is the ability to retrieve an icon by their name This was previously not possible because a mapping from name to icon would break all discussed optimizations Please bear in mind that this is still the case As all icons could theoretically be requested none can be removed by flutter It is strongly advised to only use this option in conjunction with a limited set of styles and with as few of them as possible You may need to build your app with the flag for it to succeed Using the new configurator tool this is now an optional feature Run the tool with the dynamic flag to generate dynamic and the following import to use the map For normal icons use faIconNameMapping with a key of this format import FaIcon faIconNameMapping abacus To exclude unused styles combine the configurator options dynamic exclude solid A common use case also includes fetching css classes from a server The utility function getIconFromCss takes a string of classes and returns the icon which would be shown by a browser getIconFromCss returns the abacus icon in regular style is ignored Duotone icons Duotone support has been discontinued after font awesome changed the way they lay out the icon glyphs inside the file The new way using ligatures is not supported by flutter at the moment For more information on why duotone icon support was discontinued see this comment FAQ Why are the icons aligned properly or why are the icons being cut off Please use the FaIcon widget provided by the library instead of the Icon widget provided by Flutter The Icon widget assumes all icons are square but many Font Awesome Icons are not What about file size and ram usage This package has been written in a way so that it only uses the minimum amount of resources required All links eg to unused icons will be removed automatically which means only required icon definitions are loaded into ram Flutter added icon tree shaking This means unused icon images will be removed as well However this only applies to styles of which at least one icon has been used Assuming only icons of style regular are being used regular will be minified to only include the used icons and solid and brands will stay in their raw complete form This issue is being tracked over in the flutter repository However using the configurator you can easily exclude styles from the package For more information see customizing font awesome flutter Why are the icons showing up on Mobile devices If you not seeing any icons at all sometimes it means that Flutter has a cached version of the app on device and has pushed the new fonts I run into that as well a few times Please try Stopping the app Running flutter clean in your app directory Deleting the app from your simulator emulator device Rebuild Deploy the app Why are the icons showing up on Web Most likely the fonts were not correctly added to the Note older versions of Flutter did not properly package fonts in the during the build step but that issue has been resolved and this should be much of a problem these days Please ensure you are using Flutter beta or newer Why does not run the configurator This is most probably due to missing file permissions Downloaded scripts can not be executed by default Either give

packagesPackage scoring and pub pointsFlutter Using packagesDeveloping packages and pluginsPublishing a packageDart Using packagesPublishing a copied to clipboardPublished days ago direct Service Locator that allows to decouple the interface from a concrete implementation and to access the concrete implementation from everywhere in your App More ReadmeChangelogExampleInstallingVersionsScores Sponsor Check out my new package the state management addon to There is now a discord support channel for my packages https This is a simple Service Locator for Dart and Flutter projects with some additional goodies highly inspired by Splat It can be used instead of InheritedWidget or Provider to access objects from your UI Typical usage Accessing service objects like REST API clients or databases so that they easily can be mocked Accessing from Flutter Views Why GetIt As your App grows at some point you will need to put your app logic in classes that are separated from your Widgets Keeping your widgets from having direct dependencies makes your code better organized and easier to test and maintain But now you need a way to access these objects from your UI code When I came to Flutter from the world the only way to do this was the use of InheritedWidgets I found the way to use them by wrapping them in a StatefulWidget quite cumbersome and have problems working consistently Also I missed the ability to easily switch the implementation for a mocked version without changing the UI The fact that you need a BuildContext to access your objects made it inaccessible from the Business layer Accessing an object from anywhere in an App can be done in other ways but If you use a Singleton you ca easily switch the implementation out for a mock version in tests IoC containers for Dependency Injections offer similar functionality but with the cost of slow time and less readability because you do know where the magically injected object comes from Most IoC libs rely on reflection they can not be ported to Flutter As I was used to using the Service Locator Splat from I decided to port it to Dart Since then more features have been added If you are not familiar with the concept of Service Locators it a way to decouple the interface abstract base class from a concrete implementation and at the same time allows to access the concrete implementation from everywhere in your App over the interface I can only highly recommend reading this classic article by Martin Fowler Inversion of Control Containers and the Dependency Injection pattern GetIt is Extremely fast O Easy to Does clutter your UI tree with special Widgets to access your data like Provider or Redux does GetIt is a state management solution It a locator for your objects so you need some other way to notify your UI about changes like Streams or ValueNotifiers But together with my package it gets a easy to use state management solution that integrates with the Objects registered in Getting Started At your you register all the objects you want to access later like this final getIt void setup AppModel AppModel Alternatively you could write it if you do like global variables AppModel AppModel After that you can access your AppModel class from anywhere like this MaterialButton child Text Update onPressed getIt AppModel given that your AppModel has a method update You can find here a detailed blog post on how to use GetIt GetIt in Detail As Dart supports global or euphemistic ambient variables I often assign my GetIt instance to a global variable to make access to it as easy as possible Although the approach with a global variable worked well it has its limitations if you want to use GetIt across multiple packages Therefore GetIt itself is a singleton and the default way to access an instance of GetIt is to call GetIt getIt is also a shortcut if you do like it just ignore it GetIt getIt Through this any call to instance in any package of a project will get the same instance of GetIt I still recommend just assigning the instance to a global variable in your project as it is more convenient and does harm Also it allows you to give your service locator your own name GetIt getIt You can use any name you want which makes Brian happy like sl backend services Before you can access your objects you have to register them within GetIt typically direct in your code AppModel AppModelImplementation RESTAPI RestAPIImplementation if you want to work just with the singleton AppModel AppModelImplementation RESTAPI RestAPIImplementation AppModel and RESTAPI are both abstract base classes in this example To access the registered objects call get Type on your GetIt instance var myAppModel AppModel Alternatively as GetIt is a callable class depending on the name you choose for your GetIt instance you can use the shorter version var myAppModel getIt AppModel as Singleton var myAppModel AppModel var myAppModel AppModel Different ways of registration GetIt offers different ways how objects are registered that affect the lifetime of these objects Factory void registerFactory T FactoryFunc T func You have to pass a factory function func that returns a NEW instance of an implementation of Each time you call get T you will get a new instance returned How to pass parameters to a factory you can find here Singleton LazySingleton Although I always would recommend using an abstract base class as a registration type so that you can vary the implementations you do have to do this You can also register concrete types T registerSingleton T T instance You have to pass an instance of T or a derived class of T that you will always get returned on a call to get T The newly registered instance is also returned which can be sometimes convenient As creating this instance can be at app you can shift the creation to the time the object is the first time requested with void registerLazySingleton T FactoryFunc T func You have to pass a factory function func that returns an instance of an implementation of Only the first time you call get T this factory function will be called to create a new instance After that you will always get the same instance returned Overwriting registrations If you try to register a type more than once you will fail with an assertion in debug mode because normally this is not needed and probably a bug If you really have to overwrite a registration then you can by setting the property allowReassignment true Skip Double registrations while testing If you try to register a type more than once and when allowReassignment false you will fail with an assertion in debug mode If you want to just skip this double registration silently without an error then you can by setting the property skipDoubleRegistration true This is only available inside tests where is can be handy Testing if a Singleton is already registered You can check if a certain Type or instance is already registered in GetIt with Tests if an instance of an object or aType T or a name instanceName is registered inside GetIt bool isRegistered T Object instance String instanceName Unregistering Singletons or Factories If you need to you can also unregister your registered singletons and factories and pass an optional disposingFunction for Unregister an instance of an object or a by Type T or by name instanceName if you need to dispose some resources before the reset you can provide a disposingFunction This function overrides the disposing you might have provided when registering void unregister T Object instance String instanceName void Function T disposingFunction Resetting LazySingletons In some cases you might not want to unregister a LazySingleton but instead reset its instance so that it gets newly created on the next access to it Clears the instance of a lazy singleton being able to call the factory function on the next call of get on that type again you select the lazy Singleton you want to reset by either providing an instance its registered type T or its registration name if you need to dispose some resources before the reset you can provide a disposingFunction This function overrides the disposing you might have provided when registering void resetLazySingleton T Object instance String instanceName void Function T disposingFunction Resetting GetIt completely Disposes all registered types in the reverse order in which they were registered Handy when writing unit tests or before quitting your application If you provided dispose function when registering they will be called dispose if false it only resets without calling any dispose functions As dispose funcions can be async you should await this function Future void reset bool dispose true Scopes With of GetIt it now supports hierarchical scoping of registration What does this mean You can push a new registration scope like you push a new page on the Navigator Any registration after that will be registered in this new scope When accessing an object with get GetIt first checks the topmost scope for registration and then the ones below This means you can register the same type that was already registered in a lower scope again in the scope above and you will always get the latest registered object Imagine an app that can be used with or without a login On App a DefaultUser object is registered with the abstract type User as a singleton As soon as the user logs in a new scope is pushed and a new LoggedInUser object again with the User type is registered that allows more functions For the rest of the App nothing has changed as it still accesses User objects through GetIt As soon as the user Logs off all you have to do is pop the Scope and automatically the DefaultUser is used again Another example could be a shopping basket where you want to ensure that not a cart from a previous session is used again So at the beginning of a new session you push a new scope and register a new cart object At the end of the session you pop this scope again Scope functions Creates a new registration scope If you register types after creating a new scope they will hide any previous registration of the same type Scopes allow you to manage different live times of your Objects scopeName if you name a scope you can pop all scopes above the named one by using the name dispose function that will be called when you pop this scope The scope is still valid while it is executed init optional function to register Objects immediately after the new scope is pushed This ensures that onScopeChanged will be called after their registration if isFinal is set to true you ca register any new objects in this scope after this call In Other words you have to register the objects for this scope inside init if you set isFinal to true This is useful if you want to ensure that no new objects are registered in this scope by accident which could lead to race conditions void pushNewScope void Function GetIt getIt init String scopeName ScopeDisposeFunc dispose Disposes all that have been registered in this scope and pops destroys the scope so that the previous scope gets active again if you provided dispose functions on registration they will be called if you passed a dispose function when you pushed this scope it will be called before the scope is popped As dispose functions can be async you should await this function Future void popScope if you have a lot of scopes with names you can pop see popScope all scopes above the scope with name including that scope unless inclusive false Scopes are popped in order from the top As dispose functions can be async you should await this function If no scope with name exists nothing is popped and false is returned Future bool popScopesTill String name bool inclusive true Clears all registered factories and singletons in the provided scope then destroys drops the scope If the dropped scope was the last one the previous scope becomes active again if you provided dispose functions on registration they will be called if you passed a dispose function when you pushed this scope it will be called before the scope is dropped As dispose functions can be async you should await this function Future void dropScope String scopeName Tests if the scope by name scopeName is registered in GetIt bool hasScope String scopeName Clears all registered types for the current scope in the reverse order in which they were registered If you provided dispose function when registering they will be called dispose if false it only resets without calling any dispose functions As dispose funcions can be async you should await this function Future void resetScope bool dispose true Getting notified about the shadowing state of an object In some cases it might be helpful to know if an Object gets shadowed by another one if it has some Stream subscriptions that it wants to cancel before the shadowing object creates a new subscription Also the other way round so that a shadowed Object gets notified when it active again meaning when a shadowing object is removed For this a class had to implement the ShadowChangeHandlers interface abstract class ShadowChangeHandlers void onGetShadowed Object shadowing void onLeaveShadow Object shadowing When the Object is shadowed its onGetShadowed method is called with the object that is shadowing it When this object is removed from GetIt onLeaveShadow will be called Getting notified when a scope change happens When using scopes with objects that shadow other objects it important to give the UI a chance to rebuild and acquire references to the now active objects For this you can register a function in GetIt The has a matching rebuiltOnScopeChange method Optional that will get called whenever a change in the current scope happens This can be very helpful to update the UI in such a case to make sure it uses the correct Objects after a scope change void Function bool pushed onScopeChanged Disposing Singletons and Scopes From on you can pass a dispose function when registering any Singletons For this the registration functions have an optional parameter DisposingFunc T dispose where DisposingFunc is defined as typedef DisposingFunc T FutureOr Function T param So you can pass simple or async functions as this parameter This function is called when you pop or reset the scope or when you reset GetIt completely When you push a new scope you can also pass a dispose function that is called when a scope is popped or reset but before the dispose functions of the registered objects is called which means it can still access the objects that were registered in that scope Implementing the Disposable interface Instead of passing a disposing function on registration or when pushing a Scope from on your objects onDispose method will be called if the object that you register implements the Disposable interface abstract class Disposable FutureOr onDispose Asynchronous Factories If a factory needs to call an async function you can use registerFactoryAsync T type to register func factory function for this type instanceName if you provide a value here your factory gets registered with that name instead of a type This should only be necessary if you need to register more than one instance of one type void registerFactoryAsync T FactoryFuncAsync T func String instanceName To access instances created by such a factory you ca use get but you have to use getAsync so that you can await the creation of the requested new instance Returns a Future of an instance that is created by an async factory or a Singleton that is not ready with its initialization Future T getAsync T String instanceName Asynchronous Singletons Additionally you can register asynchronous Singletons which means Singletons that have an initialization that requires async function calls To be able to control such asynchronous behaviour GetIt supports mechanisms to ensure the correct initialization sequence You create a Singleton with an asynchronous creation function void registerSingletonAsync T FactoryFuncAsync T factoryfunc String instanceName Iterable Type dependsOn bool signalsReady false The difference to a normal Singleton is that you do pass an existing instance but provide a factory function that returns a Future that completes at the end of factoryFunc and signals that the Singleton is ready to use unless true is passed for signalsReady see next chapter To synchronize with other async Singletons you can pass a list of Types in dependsOn that have to be ready before the passed factory is executed There are two ways to signal the system that an instance is ready Synchronizing asynchronous initializations of Singletons Often your registered services need to do asynchronous initialization work before they can be used from the rest of the app As this is such a common task and it closely related to GetIt supports you here too GetIt has the function allReady which returns Future void that can be used with a Flutter FutureBuilder to await that all asynchronous initialization is finished Future void allReady Duration timeout bool ignorePendingAsyncCreation false There are different approaches to how the returned Future can be completed Using async Singletons If you register any async Singletons allReady will complete only after all of them have completed their factory functions Like class RestService Future RestService init async Duration seconds return this final getIt in your setup function ConfigService async final configService ConfigService await return configService RestService async RestService here we asume an async factory function createDbServiceAsync DbService createDbServiceAsync in your startup page return FutureBuilder future builder BuildContext context AsyncSnapshot snapshot if return Scaffold body Center child Text first real Page of your App else return CircularProgressIndicator The above example shows you different ways to register async Singletons The page will display a CircularProgressIndicator until all services have been created Solving dependencies Automatic using dependsOn In a case these services have to be initialized in a certain order because they depend on that other services are already ready to be used you can use the dependsOn parameter of registerFactoryAsync If you have a Singleton that depends on other Singletons there is registerSingletonWithDependencies In the following example DbService depends on ConfigService and AppModel depends on ConfigService and RestService ConfigService async final configService ConfigService await return configService RestService async RestService DbService createDbServiceAsync dependsOn ConfigService AppModel AppModelImplmentation dependsOn ConfigService DbService RestService When using dependsOn you ensure that the registration waits with creating its singleton on the completion of the type defined in dependsOn The dependsOn field also accepts InitDependency classes that allow specifying the dependency by type and instanceName RestService async RestService instanceName AppModel AppModelImplmentation dependsOn InitDependency RestService instanceName Manually signaling the ready state of a Singleton Sometimes the mechanism of dependsOn might not give you enough control For this case you can use isReady to wait for a certain singleton Returns a Future that completes if the instance of a Singleton defined by Type T or by name instanceName or passing the an existing instance is ready If you pass a timeout a WaitingTimeOutException will be thrown if the instance is not ready in the given time The Exception contains details on which Singletons are not ready at that time callee optional parameter which makes debugging easier Pass this in here Future void isReady T Object instance String instanceName Duration timeout Object callee To signal that a singleton is ready it can use signalReady provided you have set the optional signalsReady parameter when registering it OR make your registration type implement the empty abstract class WillSignalReady Otherwise allReady will wait on a call to signalsReady No automatic signaling will happen in that case Typically this is used in this way inside the registered objects init method this void signalReady Object instance You can use this to initialize your Singletons without async registration by using fire and forget async function from your constructors like so class ConfigService ConfigService init Future init async do your async initialisation this Using allReady repeatedly Even if you already have awaited allReady the moment you register new async singletons or singletons with dependencies you can use allReady again This makes especially sense if you use scopes where every scope needs to get initialized Manual triggering allReady almost deprecated By calling signalReady null on your GetIt instance the Future you can get from allReady will be completed This is the most basic way to synchronize your If you want to do that do use signalsReady or async Singletons I recommend using one of the other ways because they are more flexible and express your intention more clear You can find here a detailed blog post on async factories and startup synchronization Passing Parameters to factories In some cases it handy if you could pass changing values to factories when calling get For that there are two variants for registering factories registers a type so that a new instance will be created on each call of get on that type based on up to two parameters provided to get T type to register type of type of if you use only one parameter pass void here factoryfunc factory function for this type that accepts two parameters instanceName if you provide a value here your factory gets registered with that name instead of a type This should only be necessary if you need to register more than one instance of one type example TestClassParam String int s i TestClassParam s i if you only use one parameter TestClassParam String void s TestClassParam s void registerFactoryParam T FactoryFuncParam T factoryfunc String instanceName and void registerFactoryParamAsync T FactoryFuncParamAsync T factoryfunc String instanceName The reason why I settled to use two parameters is that I can imagine some scenarios where you might want to register a builder function for Flutter Widgets that need to get a BuildContext and some data object When accessing these factories you pass the parameters a optional arguments to get var instance getIt TestClassParam These parameters are passed as dynamics otherwise I would have had to add more generic parameters to get but they are checked at runtime to be the correct types Testing with GetIt Unit Tests When you are writing unit tests with GetIt in your App you have two possibilities Register all the Objects you need inside your unit Tests so that GetIt can provide its objects to the objects that you are testing Pass your dependent objects into the constructor of your test objects like GetIt getIt class UserManager AppModel appModel DbService dbService UserManager AppModel appModel DbService dbService appModel AppModel dbService DbService This way you do need to pass them in the AppModel and dbService inside your App but you can pass them or a mocked version in your Unit tests Integration Tests If you have a mocked version of a Service you can easily switch between that and the real one based on a flag if testing AppModel AppModelMock else AppModel AppModelImplementation Experts region Named registration Ok you have been warned All registration functions have an optional named parameter instanceName Providing a name with here registers that instance with that name and a type Consequently get has also an optional parameter instanceName to access that were registered by name IMPORTANT Each name must be unique per type abstract class RestService class implements RestService Future init async Duration seconds return this class implements RestService Future init async Duration seconds return this RestService async instanceName RestService async instanceName AppModel RestService RestService instanceName return AppModelImplmentation dependsOn InitDependency RestService instanceName Accessing an object inside GetIt by a runtime type In rare occasions you might be faced with the problem that you do know the type that you want to retrieve from GetIt at compile time which means you ca pass it as a generic parameter For this the get functions have an optional type parameter TestClass final type TestClass expect is TestClass true Be careful that the receiving variable has the correct type and do pass type and a generic parameter More than one instance of GetIt While not recommended you can create your own independent instance of GetIt if you do want to share your locator with some other package or because the physics of your planet demands it To make sure you really know what you are doing you have to first enable this feature GetIt myOwnInstance This new instance does not share any registrations with the singleton instance Acknowledgements Many thanks to the insightful discussions on the API with Brian Egan and Simon Lightfoot direct Service Locator that allows to decouple the interface from a

escape except exists foreign from group having if in index insert intersect into is isnull join limit not notnull null on or order primary references select set table then to transaction union unique update using values when where the helper will escape the name will be equivalent to manually adding around the table name confusingly here named table FROM table However in any other raw statement including orderBy where groupBy make sure to escape the name properly using double quote For example see below where the column name group is not escaped in the columns argument but is escaped in the where argument columns where group whereArgs Supported SQLite types No validity check is done on values yet so please avoid non supported types https DateTime is not a supported SQLite type Personally I store them as int millisSinceEpoch or string bool is not a supported SQLite type Use INTEGER and and values More information on supported types here INTEGER Dart type int Supported values from to REAL Dart type num TEXT Dart type String BLOB Dart type Current issues Due to the way transaction works in SQLite threads concurrent read and write transaction are not supported All calls are currently synchronized and transactions block are exclusive I thought that a basic way to support concurrent access is to open a database multiple times but it only works on iOS as Android reuses the

Searching for packagesPackage scoring and pub pointsFlutter Using packagesDeveloping packages and pluginsPublishing a packageDart Using packagesPublishing a packageequatable equatable copied to clipboardPublished months ago Dart package that helps to implement value based equality without needing to explicitly override and ReadmeChangelogExampleInstallingVersionsScores Simplify Equality Comparisons Overview Being able to compare objects in Dart often involves having to override the operator as well as hashCode Not only is it verbose and tedious but failure to do so can lead to inefficient code which does not behave as we expect By default returns true if two objects are the same instance Let say we have the following class class Person const Person final String name We can create instances of Person like so void main final Person bob Person Bob Later if we try to compare two instances of Person either in our production code or in our tests we will run into a problem print bob Person Bob false For more information about this you can check out the official Dart Documentation In order to be able to compare two instances of Person we need to change our class to override and hashCode like so class Person const Person final String name override bool operator Object other identical this other other is Person runtimeType name override int get hashCode Now if we run the following code again print bob Person Bob true it will be able to compare different instances of Person You can see how this can quickly become a hassle when dealing with complex classes This is where Equatable comes in What does Equatable do Equatable overrides and hashCode for you so you do have to waste your time writing lots of boilerplate code There are other packages that will actually generate the boilerplate for you however you still have to run the code generation step which is not ideal With Equatable there is no code generation needed and we can focus more on writing amazing applications and less on mundane tasks Usage First we need to do add equatable to the dependencies of the dependencies equatable Next we need to install it Dart pub get Flutter flutter packages get Lastly we need to extend Equatable import class Person extends Equatable const Person final String name override List Object get props name When working with json import class Person extends Equatable const Person final String name override List Object get props name factory Map String dynamic json return Person json We can now compare instances of Person just like before without the pain of having to write all of that boilerplate Note Equatable is designed to only work with immutable objects so all member variables must be final This is not just a feature of Equatable overriding a hashCode with a mutable value can break collections Equatable also supports const constructors import class Person extends Equatable const Person final String name override List Object get props name toString Implementation Equatable can implement toString method including all the given props If you want that behaviour for a specific Equatable object just include the following override bool get stringify true For instance import class Person extends Equatable const Person final String name override List Object get props name override bool get stringify true For the name Bob the output will be Person Bob This flag by default is false and toString will return just the type Person EquatableConfig stringify can also be configured globally for all Equatable instances via EquatableConfig true If stringify is overridden for a specific Equatable class then the value of is ignored In other words the local configuration always takes precedence over the global configuration Note defaults to true in debug mode and false in release mode Recap Without Equatable class Person const Person final String name override bool operator Object other identical this other other is Person runtimeType name override int get hashCode With Equatable import class Person extends Equatable const Person final String name override List Object get props name EquatableMixin Sometimes it is possible to extend Equatable because your class already has a superclass In this case you can still get the benefits of Equatable by using the EquatableMixin Usage Let say we want to make an EquatableDateTime class we can use EquatableMixin like so class EquatableDateTime extends DateTime with EquatableMixin EquatableDateTime int year int month int day int hour int minute int second int millisecond int microsecond super year month day hour minute second millisecond microsecond override List Object get props return year month day hour minute second millisecond microsecond Now if we want to create a subclass of EquatableDateTime we can just override props class EquatableDateTimeSubclass extends EquatableDateTime final int century EquatableDateTimeSubclass int year int month int day int hour int minute int second int millisecond int microsecond super year month day hour minute second millisecond microsecond override List Object get props addAll century Performance You might be wondering what the performance impact will be if you use Equatable Results average over runs Equality Comparison A A Class Runtime μs Manual Empty Equatable Hydrated Equatable Instantiation A Class

in the web platform this request must be initiated from an user interaction like a button press Future void async final bool isAuthorized await scopes if isAuthorized unawaited The requestScopes returns a boolean value that is true if the user has granted all the requested scopes or false otherwise Once your app determines that the current user isAuthorized to access the services for which you need scopes it can proceed normally Authorization expiration In the web the accessToken is no longer refreshed It expires after seconds one hour so your app needs to be able to handle failed REST

clipboardPublished days ago plugin for easy access to device location in ReadmeChangelogExampleInstallingVersionsScoreslocation This plugin for Flutter handles getting a location on Android and iOS It also provides callbacks when the location is changed Web demo more features available on Getting Started Add this to your package file dependencies location Android To use location background mode on Android you have to use the enableBackgroundMode bool enable API before accessing location in the background and adding necessary permissions You should place the required permissions in your applications android android Remember that the user has to accept the location permission to always allow to use the background location The Android option to always allow is not presented on the location permission dialog prompt The user has to enable it manually from the app settings This should be explained to the user on a separate UI that redirects the user to the app location settings managed by the operating system More on that topic can be found on Android developer pages iOS And to use it in iOS you have to add this permission in This is probably the only one you need Background location is supported by this the caveat is that a blue badge is shown in the status bar when the app is using location service while in the background NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription Deprecated use NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription instead NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription Use this very carefully This key is required only if your iOS app uses APIs that access the user s location information at all times even if the app is running NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription To receive location when application is in background to you have to add property list key UIBackgroundModes with string value location Web Nothing to do the plugin works directly out of box macOS Ensure that the application is properly sandboxed and that the location is enabled You can do this in Xcode with the following steps In the project navigator click on your application target This should bring up a view with tabs such as General Capabilities Resource Tags etc Click on the Capabilities tab This will give you a list of items such as App Groups App Sandbox and so on Each item will have an button Turn on the App Sandbox item and press the button on the left to show the sandbox stuff In the App Data section select Location Add this permission in NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription Usage Then you just have to import the package with import In order to request location you should always check Location Service status and Permission status manually Location location new Location bool PermissionStatus LocationData await if await if return await if await if return await You can also get continuous callbacks when your position is changing LocationData currentLocation Use current location To receive location when application is in background you have to enable it enable true Be sure to check the example project to get other code samples On Android a foreground notification is displayed with information that location service is running in the background On iOS while the app is in the background and gets the location the blue system bar notifies users about updates Tapping on this bar moves the User back to the app Public Methods Summary Return Description Future PermissionStatus requestPermission Request the Location permission Return a PermissionStatus to know if the permission has been granted Future

Apple Flutter bridge to Sign in with Apple Supports login via an Apple ID as well as retrieving credentials saved in the user keychain Supported platforms iOS macOS Android Web Example Usage SignInWithAppleButton onPressed async final credential await scopes print credential Now send the credential especially to your server to create a session after they have been validated with Apple see Integration section for more information on how to do this Flow Integration Integrating Sign in with Apple goes beyond just adding this plugin to your and using the functions exposed by it Once you receive the credentials they need to be verified with Apple servers to ensure that they are valid and really concern the mentioned user and then a new session should be derived from them in your system Your server should then daily verify the session with Apple via a refresh token it obtained on the initial validation and revoke the session in your system if the authorization has been withdrawn on Apple side Prerequisites Before you can start integrating or even testing Sign in with Apple you need a paid membership to the Apple Developer Program Sign in with Apple is one of the restricted services which is not available for free with just an Apple ID source Setup Register an App ID If you do have one yet create a new one at https following these steps Click Register an App ID In the wizard select App IDs click Continue Set the Description and Bundle ID and select the Sign In with Apple capability Usually the default setting of Enable as a primary App ID should suffice here If you ship multiple apps that should all share the same Apple ID credentials for your users please consult the Apple documentation on how to best set these up Click Continue and then click Register to finish the creation of the App ID In case you already have an existing App ID that you want to use with Sign in with Apple Open that App ID from the list Check the Sign in with Apple capability Click Save If you have change your app capabilities you need to fetch the updated provisioning profiles for example via Xcode to use the new capabilities Create a Service ID The Service ID is only needed for a Web or Android integration If you only intend to integrate iOS you can skip this step Go to your apple developer page then Identifiers and follow these steps Next go to https and follow these steps Click Register an Services ID Select Services IDs click Continue Set your Description and Identifier The Identifier will later be referred to as your clientID Click Continue and then Register Now that the service is created we have to enable it to be used for Sign in with Apple Select the service from the list of services Check the box next to Sign in with Apple then click Configure In the Domains and Subdomains add the domains of the websites on which you want to use Sign in with Apple You have to enter at least one domain here even if you do intend to use Sign in with Apple on any website In the Return URLs box add the full return URL you want to use https Click Next and then Done to close the settings dialog Click Continue and then Save to update the service In order to communicate with Apple servers to verify the incoming authorization codes from your app clients you need to create a key at https Click Create a key Set the Key Name Sign in with Apple key Check the box next to Sign in with Apple then click Configure on the same row Under Primary App ID select the App ID of the app you want to use either the newly created one or an existing one Click Save to leave the detail view Click Continue and then click Register Now you see a screen where you must download the key by clicking the Download button Also note the Key ID which will be used later when configuring the server Now everything is set up on Apple developer portal and we can start setting up the server Server The server part is usually integrated into your existing backends and there are existing packages for most existing programming languages and web frameworks out there In order to show how to build a complete example we set up a example project on Glitch which offers simple and free hosting of a web API which is exactly what needed here To get started with the example go to the project page at https and click Remix this Now you have your own copy of the sample server First select the file in the file browser on the left and put in your credentials these will not be public but only shared with invited collaborators Then click on the Share button next to your avatar in the upper left select Live App and copy the entry page URL https Now update the services you created earlier at https to include the following URL under Return URLs https replacing the name inside the After this is done you can now proceed to integrate Sign in with Apple into the code of your Flutter app Android Adding Sign in with Apple to a Flutter app is shown from sides here First we look into making the example app work with our setup and then we go over the additional steps required to set up your app from scratch To use this plugin on Android you will need to use the Android Embedding You can find out if you are already using the new embedding by looking into your and look for the following element android flutterEmbedding android In case you are not yet using Android Embedding please first upgrade your app using the following guide https launchMode To ensure that deep links from the login web page shown in a Chrome Custom Tab back to the app still work your app must use launchMode singleTask or singleTop When using singleTask the Chrome Custom Tab persists across app switches from within Android app switcher but will be dismissed when the app is launched anew from the home screen icon app gallery With launch mode singleTop the Chrome Custom Tab stays present both after using the app switcher or launching the app anew via its icon If you change your app launchMode be sure to test any other integrations that might be affected by this deep links Web For web support you need to add the follow script import to your head tag script https We have found a way to only load this on demand as the script seemingly inits itself on page load Then in the service configuration in Apple developer portal add the domains that host your page both in Domains and Subdomains as well as Returns URLs The former is needed so you can open the flow from the web page while the latter is used to post the final credentials back from the to the opening page If you omit this the flow will just silently be stuck in the last step Example App Open the example folder inside this package in an editor of your choice Run flutter packages get Open and look at the callback Set the scopes parameter to your required scopes for testing we can keep requesting a name and email Update the values passed to the WebAuthenticationOptions constructor to match the values in the Apple Developer Portal Likewise update the signInWithAppleEndpoint variable to point to your Once you have updated the code flutter run the example on an Android device or emulator Your App In your inside application add Set up the Sign in with Apple activity such that it callable from the activity android android true action android category android category android data android signinwithapple data android callback On the Sign in with Apple callback on your server specified in redirect safely back to your Android app using the following URL intent PARAMETERS FROM CALLBACK BODY Intent end The PARAMETERS FROM CALLBACK BODY should be filled with the urlencoded body you receive on the endpoint from Apple server and the package parameter should be changed to match your app package identifier as published on the Google Play Store Leave the callback path and signinwithapple scheme untouched Furthermore when handling the incoming credentials on the client make sure to only overwrite the current guest session of the user once your own server have validated the incoming code parameter such that your app is not susceptible to malicious incoming links logging out the current user iOS At this point you should have added the Sign in with Apple capability to either your own app capabilities or the test application you created to run the example In case you do have Automatically manage Signing turned on in Xcode you will need to recreate and download the updated Provisioning Profiles for your app so they include the new Sign in with Apple capability Then you can download the new certificates and select them in Xcode In case XCode manages your signing this step will be done automatically for you Just make sure the Sign in with Apple capability is actived as described in the example below Additionally this assumes that you have at least one iOS device registered in your developer account for local testing so you can run the example on a device Example Open the example folder in a terminal and run flutter packages get Open in Xcode Under Runner file browser side bar Targets Runner Signing Capabilities set the Bundle Identifier App ID you have created in the Apple Developer Portal earlier Ensure that Sign in with Apple is listed under the capabilities if not add it via the Now open a terminal in the example folder and execute the follow commands cd ios bundle install to install the Ruby dependencies used for Cocoapods bundle exec pod install to install the Cocoapods for the iOS project In the terminal navigate back to the root of the example folder and flutter run on your test device Your App First and foremost make sure that your app has the Sign in with Apple capability Runner file browser side bar Targets Runner Signing Capabilities as otherwise Sign in with Apple will fail without visual indication the code will still receive exceptions Either integrate the example server as shown above or build your own backend Ensure that the clientID used when validating the received code parameter with Apple server is dependent on the client Use the App ID also called Bundle ID in some places when using codes from apps running on Apple platforms and use the service ID when using a code retrieved from a web authentication flow macOS The setup for macOS is mostly similar to iOS As usual for Flutter development for macOS you must be on the dev or master channel Example Open the example folder in a terminal and run flutter packages get Open in Xcode Under Runner file browser side bar Targets Runner Signing Capabilities set the Bundle Identifier App ID you have created in the Apple Developer Portal earlier Ensure that Sign in with Apple is listed under the capabilities if not add it via the Additionally there should be no warning on that screen For example your Mac must be registered for local development If not you see a one click fix button to do so In the terminal navigate back to the root of the example folder and flutter run on your test device bridge to initiate Sign in with Apple on iOS macOS and Android Includes support for keychain entries as well as signing in with an Apple GitHub

support Dynamic events and holidays Vertical autosizing fit the content or fill the viewport Multiple calendar formats month two weeks week Horizontal swipe boundaries first day last day Usage Make sure to check out examples and API docs for more details Installation Add the following line to dependencies Basic setup The complete example is available here TableCalendar requires you to provide firstDay lastDay and focusedDay firstDay is the first available day for the calendar Users will not be able to access days before it lastDay is the last available day for the calendar Users will not be able to access days after it focusedDay is the currently targeted day Use this property to determine which month should be currently visible TableCalendar firstDay lastDay focusedDay Adding interactivity You will surely notice that previously set up calendar widget is quite interactive you can only swipe it horizontally to change the currently visible month While it may be sufficient in certain situations you can easily bring it to life by specifying a couple of callbacks Adding the following code to the calendar widget will allow it to respond to user taps marking the tapped day as selected selectedDayPredicate day return isSameDay day onDaySelected selectedDay focusedDay setState selectedDay focusedDay update here as well In order to dynamically update visible calendar format add those lines to the widget calendarFormat onFormatChanged format setState format Those two changes will make the calendar interactive and responsive to user input Updating focusedDay Setting focusedDay to a static value means that whenever TableCalendar widget rebuilds it will use that specific focusedDay You can quickly test it by using hot reload set focusedDay to swipe to next month and trigger a hot reload the calendar will reset to its initial state To prevent this from happening you should store and update focusedDay whenever any callback exposes it Add this one callback to complete the basic setup onPageChanged focusedDay focusedDay It is worth noting that you do need to call setState inside onPageChanged callback You should just update the stored value so that if the widget gets rebuilt later on it will use the proper focusedDay The complete example is available here You can find other examples here Events The complete example is available here You can supply custom events to TableCalendar widget To do so use eventLoader property you will be given a DateTime object to which you need to assign a list of events eventLoader day return day can be of any implementation For example a Map DateTime List T can be used List Event DateTime day return events day One thing worth remembering is that DateTime objects consist of both date and time parts In many cases this time part is redundant for calendar related aspects If you decide to use a Map I suggest making it a LinkedHashMap this will allow you to override equality comparison for two DateTime objects comparing them just by their date parts final events LinkedHashMap equals isSameDay hashCode getHashCode addAll eventSource Cyclic events eventLoader allows you to easily add events that repeat in a pattern For example this will add an event to every Monday eventLoader day if return Event event return Events selected on tap Often times having a sublist of events that are selected by tapping on a day is desired You can achieve that by using the same method you provided to eventLoader inside of onDaySelected callback void DateTime selectedDay DateTime focusedDay if isSameDay selectedDay setState focusedDay selectedDay selectedDay The complete example is available here Custom UI with CalendarBuilders To customize the UI with your own widgets use CalendarBuilders Each builder can be used to selectively override the UI allowing you to implement highly specific designs with minimal hassle You can return null from any builder to use the default style For example the following snippet will override only the Sunday day of the week label Sun leaving other dow labels unchanged calendarBuilders CalendarBuilders dowBuilder context day if final text day return Center child Text text style TextStyle color Locale To display the calendar in desired language use locale property If you do specify it a default locale will be used Initialization Before you can use a locale you might need to initialize date formatting A simple way of doing it is as follows First of all add intl package to your file Then make modifications to your main import void main initializeDateFormatting runApp MyApp After those two steps your app should be ready to use TableCalendar with different languages Specifying a language To specify a language simply pass it as a String code to locale property For example this will make TableCalendar use Polish language TableCalendar locale Note that if you want to change the language of FormatButton text you have to do this yourself Use availableCalendarFormats property and pass the translated Strings there Use method of your choice You can also hide the button altogether by setting formatButtonVisible to false

beautiful animated effects builders in Flutter via an easy customizable unified ReadmeChangelogExampleInstallingVersionsScores Flutter Animate A performant library that makes it simple to add almost any kind of animated effect in Flutter effects like fade scale slide align flip blur shake shimmer shadows crossfades follow path and color effects saturation color and tint Apply animated GLSL fragment shaders to widgets Easy custom effects and simplified animated builders Synchronize animations to scroll notifiers or anything Integrated events All via a simple unified API without fussing with AnimationController and StatefulWidget Above The included example app Duration extensions Extension methods for num to make specifying durations easier For example or AnimatedController extensions A loop extension method for AnimatedController which is identical to repeat but adds a count parameter to specifiy how many times to play Basics Syntax To apply effects wrap the target widget in Animate and specify a list of effects Animate effects FadeEffect ScaleEffect child Text Hello World It also adds an extension method to all widgets which wraps the widget in Animate Each effect also adds a chainable extension method to Animate to enable a shorthand syntax Text Hello World NOTE The shortform style is used in this README but all functionality is available in either format Delay duration curve Effects have optional delay duration and curve parameters Effects run in parallel but you can use a delay to run them sequentially Text Hello duration delay runs after fade Note that effects are active for the duration of the full animation so for example two fade effects on the same target can have unexpected results SwapEffect detailed below can help address this If not specified or null these values are inherited from the previous effect or from and if it is the first effect Text Hello World uses inherits duration from fadeIn delay duration runs after the above duration inherits the delay duration from move Animate has its own delay parameter which defines a delay before the animation begins playing Unlike the delay on an Effect it is only applied once if the animation repeats Text Hello delay this delay only happens once at the very start onPlay controller loop delay this delay happens at the start of each loop Other Effect Parameters Most effects include begin and end parameters which specify the values These are usually smart in the sense that if only one is specified then the other will default to a neutral value ie no visual effect If both are unspecified the effect should use visually pleasing defaults an opacity of is neutral Text Hello Text Hello begin Text Hello end Many effects have additional parameters that influence their behavior These should also use pleasant defaults if unspecified Text color Sequencing with ThenEffect ThenEffect is a special convenience effect that makes it easier to sequence effects It does this by establishing a new baseline time equal to the previous effect end time and its own optional delay All subsequent effect delays are relative to this new baseline In the following example the slide would run after the fade ended Text Hello duration delay Animating lists The AnimateList class offers similar functionality for lists of widgets with the option to offset each child animation by a specified interval Column children AnimateList interval effects FadeEffect duration children Text Hello Text World Text Goodbye or shorthand Column children Text Hello Text World Text Goodbye interval duration Shared effects Because Effect instances are immutable they can be reused This makes it easy to create a global collection of effects that are used throughout your app and updated in one place This is also useful for design systems Effect FadeEffect duration curve ScaleEffect begin curve then Text effects Custom effects builders It is easy to write new resuable effects by extending Effect but you can also easily create custom effects by using CustomEffect ToggleEffect and SwapEffect CustomEffect CustomEffect lets you build custom animated effects Simply specify a builder function that accepts a context value and child The child is the target of the animation which may already have been wrapped in other effects For example this would add a background behind the text and fade it from red to blue Text Hello World duration builder context value child Container color value padding child child child is the Text widget being animated By default it provides a value from though some curves can generate values outside this range based on the current time duration and curve You can also specify begin and end values as demonstrated in the example below Animate can be created without a child so you use CustomEffect as a simplified builder For example this would build text counting down from and fading out Animate duration begin end builder value Text ToggleEffect ToggleEffect also provides builder functionality but instead of a double it provides a boolean value equal to true before the end of the effect and false after ie after its duration Animate duration builder value Text value Before After This can also be used to activate Animated widgets like AnimatedContainer by toggling their values with a minimal delay Animate duration builder value AnimatedContainer duration color value SwapEffect SwapEffect lets you swap out the whole target widget at a specified time Text Before duration builder Text After This can also be useful for creating sequential effects by swapping the target widget back in effectively wiping all previous effects fade out then swap in original widget fade back in via a new Animate builder child ShaderEffect ShaderEffect makes it easy to apply animated GLSL fragment shaders to widgets See the docs for details duration shader myShader duration shader can be combined with other effects Events callbacks Animate includes the following callbacks onInit the internal AnimationController has been initialized onPlay the animation has started playing after any onComplete the animation has finished These callbacks return the AnimationController which can be used to manipulate the animation ex repeat reverse etc Text Horrible Pulsing Text onPlay controller reverse true curve For more nuanced callbacks use CallbackEffect or ListenEffect CallbackEffect CallbackEffect lets you add a callback to an arbitrary postion in your animations For example adding a callback halfway through a fade Text Hello duration duration callback print As with other effects it will inherit the delay and duration of prior effects Text Hello delay duration callback print is done ListenEffect ListenEffect lets you register a callback to receive the animation value as a double for a given delay duration curve begin and end Text Hello curve callback value print opacity value The above example works because the listen effect inherits duration and curve from the fade and both use by default Adapters and Controllers By default all animations are driven by an internal AnimationController and update based on elapsed time For more control you can specify your own external controller or use an adapter You can also set if you want to start the animation manually Adapters synchronize the AnimationController to an external source For example the ScrollAdapter updates an animation based on a ScrollController so you can run complex animations based on scroll interactions You still define animations using durations but the external source must provide a value Flutter Animate ships with a collection of useful adapters Check them out for more information Reacting to State Changes Animate can react to state changes similar to Animated widgets ex AnimatedOpacity Simply set up your animation normally but set a target value When the value of target changes it will automatically animate to the new target position where is the beginning and is the end For example combined with logic that toggles via setState this will fade and scale the button on roll over MyButton target end end You can also update the value property to jump to that position Testing Animations When testing animations you can set which will cause all animations to automatically restart every time you hot reload your app Installation Grab it from beautiful animated

Biometrics canCheckBiometrics only indicates whether hardware support is available not whether the device has any biometrics enrolled To get a list of enrolled biometrics call getAvailableBiometrics The types are and and other types may be added in the future so when possible you should not rely on specific biometric types and only check that some biometric is enrolled final List BiometricType availableBiometrics await if Some biometrics are if Specific types of biometrics are available Use checks like this with caution Options The authenticate method uses biometric authentication when possible but also allows fallback to pin pattern or passcode try final bool didAuthenticate await localizedReason authenticate to show account balance on PlatformException To require biometric authentication pass AuthenticationOptions with biometricOnly set to true final bool didAuthenticate await localizedReason authenticate to show account balance options const AuthenticationOptions biometricOnly true Note biometricOnly is not supported on Windows since the Windows implementation underlying API Windows Hello does support selecting the authentication method Dialogs The plugin provides default dialogs for the following cases Not Set The user has not yet configured a passcode on iOS or on Android Biometrics Not Enrolled The user has not enrolled any biometrics on the device If a user does not have the necessary authentication enrolled when authenticate is called they will be given the option to enroll at that point or cancel authentication If you do want to use the

authenticate to show account balance options const AuthenticationOptions useErrorDialogs false on PlatformException catch e if Add handling of no hardware else if else iOS Integration Note that this plugin works with both Touch ID and Face ID However to use the latter you need to also add key NSFaceIDUsageDescription string Why is my app authenticating using face id to your file Failure to do so results in a dialog that tells the user your app has not been updated to use Face ID Android Integration The plugin will build and run on SDK but isDeviceSupported will always return false before SDK

follows resources style LaunchTheme If you do have a file for your Android project you can set up the Android theme directly in application activity android Sticky Auth You can set the stickyAuth option on the plugin to true so that plugin does not return failure if the app is put to background by the system This might happen if the user receives a phone call before they get a chance to

class which relies on events to trigger state changes rather than functions Bloc also extends BlocBase which means it has a similar public API as Cubit However rather than calling a function on a Bloc and directly emitting a new state Blocs receive events and convert the incoming events into outgoing states State changes in bloc begin when events are added which triggers onEvent The events are then funnelled through an EventTransformer By default each event is processed concurrently but a custom EventTransformer can be provided to manipulate the incoming event stream All registered EventHandlers for that event type are then invoked with the incoming event Each EventHandler is responsible for emitting zero or more states in response to the event Lastly onTransition is called just before the state is updated and contains the current state event and next state Creating a Bloc The events which CounterBloc will react to sealed class CounterEvent Notifies bloc to increment state final class CounterIncrementPressed extends CounterEvent A CounterBloc which handles converting CounterEvent s into int s class CounterBloc extends Bloc CounterEvent int The initial state of the CounterBloc is

Blocs extend BlocBase just like Cubit onChange and onError can be overridden in a Bloc as well In addition Blocs can also override onEvent and onTransition onEvent is called any time a new event is

permission to your file android If you wish to connect to URLs typically HTTP also add the following attribute to the application element application android true Note that proxy used to implement features such as headers caching and stream audio sources runs on a localhost HTTP server and this also requires cleartext access to be enabled You can either enable this via the option above which also enables access to any URL or you can instead limit cleartext access to just localhost URLs by defining a network security config To use this approach create the file xml true domain false Then reference this network security config in your file by adding the following attribute to the application element application android If you need access to the player AudioSession ID you can listen to Note that the AudioSession ID will change whenever you set new AudioAttributes If there are multiple plugins in your app that use ExoPlayer to decode media it is possible to encounter a Duplicate class error if those plugins use different versions of ExoPlayer In this case you may report an issue for each respective plugin to upgrade to the latest version of ExoPlayer or you may downgrade one or more of your app plugins until the versions match In some cases where a plugin uses parts of the ExoPlayer API you can also try forcing all plugins to use the same version of ExoPlayer by editing your own app file and inserting the dependencies for the desired Exoplayer version dependencies def implementation implementation implementation implementation iOS Using the default configuration the

There are a number of alternative options untested dependencies any substitute version number any substitute version number For issues with the Linux implementation please open an issue on the respective implementation GitHub issues page Troubleshooting Most problems you encounter when playing an audio file will likely relate to the audio file format the server headers or the file name Audio file Different platforms support different audio formats and encodings For a list see this StackOverflow answer Different audio formats have different seeking support If you have control over the encoding of the audio files your app needs to play then it is recommended to encode audio as because this is capable of embedding an accurate seek table With there are multiple different methods of encoding that permit seeking although all such methods are approximate When your app needs to play from arbitrary audio sources requested by the user you are at the mercy of the source audio format Different audio formats may or may not embed duration metadata and the absence of this metadata is a common reason why may sometimes return a null duration This behaviour is platform specific however and Android can sometimes infer the missing duration by decoding the entire file and measuring the duration Server headers A server that hosts audio content should return appropriate HTTP response headers to the client This includes an appropriate header and a correct header so that the player knows which decoder to use to read the data Servers should also support range requests These allow to make requests for a part of the whole file within a given byte range as opposed to always requesting the whole file If the user seeks to a position near the end of the audio file that has been downloaded yet and if there is a seek table will try to make a range request for the end of the file Range requests can also impact on ability to determine an audio file duration In many cases certain audio formats embed metadata which includes the audio duration at the END of the audio file and range requests allow to jump to the end of the file to fetch the metadata first without having to wait for the entire file to download and then inform you up front what the audio file duration is If returns a null duration when the audio file has duration metadata this may suggest that the server does not support range requests If you host audio files on your own server remember to correctly configure the headers described above File names When playing audio from a local file can not use any header to figure out which decoder to use to read the file Instead the file name extension will generally be used to determine the file type For example if a file name ends with the decoder will be used to read it while if the file name ends with the WAV decoder will be used If the file name has an extension but the actual file content is not in the format then may potentially fail to read it iOS enforces this fairly strictly while Android is more likely to be forgiving by taking a peek at the data to make an educated guess as to what the data format really is In general however it is recommended to use correct file name extensions for any audio file that is under your control Mixing and matching audio plugins The flutter plugin ecosystem contains a wide variety of useful audio plugins In order to allow these to work together in a single app just plays audio By focusing on a single responsibility different audio plugins can safely work together without overlapping responsibilities causing runtime conflicts Other common audio capabilities are optionally provided by separate plugins Use this to allow your app to play audio in the background and respond to controls on the lockscreen media notification headset or smart watch Use this if your app has more advanced background audio requirements than can be supported by Use this to configure and manage how

volume boost Experimental features Feature Android iOS macOS Web Simultaneous Waveform visualizer See FFT visualizer See Background Please consider reporting any bugs you encounter here or submitting pull requests here The state model The state of the player consists of two orthogonal states playing and processingState The playing state typically maps to the app button and only ever changes in response to direct method calls by the app By contrast processingState reflects the state of the underlying audio decoder and can change both in response to method calls by the app and also in response to events occurring asynchronously within the audio processing pipeline The following diagram depicts the valid state transitions This state model provides a flexible way to capture different combinations of states such as vs and this allows state to be more accurately represented in an app UI It is important to understand that even when playing true no sound will actually be audible unless processingState ready which indicates that the buffers are filled and ready to play This makes intuitive sense when imagining the playing state as mapping onto an app button When the user presses play to start a new track the button will immediately reflect the playing state change although there will be a few moments of silence while the audio is loading while processingState loading but once the buffers are finally filled processingState ready audio playback will begin When buffering occurs during playback due to a slow network connection the app button remains in the playing state although temporarily no sound will be audible while processingState buffering Sound will be audible again as soon as the buffers are filled again and processingState ready When playback reaches the end of the audio stream the player remains in the playing state with the seek bar positioned at the end of the track No sound will be audible until the app seeks to an earlier point in the stream Some apps may choose to display a replay button in place of the button at this point which calls seek When clicked playback will automatically continue from the seek point because it was never paused in the first place Other apps may instead wish to listen for the processingState completed event and programmatically pause and rewind the audio at that point Apps that wish to react to both orthogonal states through a single combined stream may listen to playerStateStream This stream will emit events that contain the latest value of both playing and processingState Configuring the audio session If your app uses audio you should tell the operating system what kind of usage scenario your app has and how your app will interact with other audio apps on the device Different audio apps often have unique requirements For example when a navigator app speaks driving instructions a music player should duck its audio while a podcast player should pause its audio Depending on which one of these three apps you are building you will need to configure your app audio settings and callbacks to appropriately handle these interactions will by default choose settings that are appropriate for a music player app which means that it will automatically duck audio when a navigator starts speaking but should pause when a phone call or another music player starts If you are building a podcast player or audio book reader this behaviour would not be appropriate While the user may be able to comprehend the navigator instructions while ducked music is playing in the background it would be much more difficult to understand the navigator instructions while simultaneously listening to an audio book or podcast You can use the package to change the default audio session configuration for your app for a podcast player you may use final session await await Note If your app uses a number of different audio plugins for audio recording or text to speech or background audio it is possible that those plugins may internally override each other audio session settings so it is recommended that you apply your own preferred configuration using after all other audio plugins have loaded You may consider asking the developer of each audio plugin you use to provide an option to not overwrite these global settings and allow them be managed externally audio player for Flutter Loop clip and

manager for flutter Saves web files on the storages of the device and saves the cache info using ReadmeChangelogExampleInstallingVersionsScoresBREAKING CHANGES IN CacheManager introduced some breaking changes when configuring a custom CacheManager See the bottom of this page for the changes A CacheManager to download and cache files in the cache directory of the app Various settings on how long to keep a file can be changed It uses the http header to efficiently retrieve files The more basic usage is explained here See the complete docs for more info Usage The cache manager can be used to get a file on various ways The easiest way to get a single file is call var file await DefaultCacheManager url getFileStream url returns a stream with the first result being the cached file and later optionally the downloaded file getFileStream url withProgress true when you set withProgress on true this stream will also emit DownloadProgress when the file is not found in the cache downloadFile url directly downloads from the web getFileFromCache only retrieves from cache and returns no file when the file is not in the cache putFile gives the option to put a new file into the cache without downloading it removeFile removes a file from the cache emptyCache removes all files from the cache ImageCacheManager If you use the ImageCacheManager mixin on the CacheManager which is already done on the DefaultCacheManager you get the following getImageFile method for free Stream FileResponse getImageFile String url String key Map String String headers bool withProgress int maxHeight This is extra int maxWidth This is extra as well The image from the url is resized within the specifications and the resized images is stored in the cache It always tries to keep the existing aspect ratios The original image is also cached and used to resize the image if you call this method with other parameters Other implementations When your files are stored on Firebase Storage you can use Customize The cache manager is customizable by creating a new CacheManager It is very important to not create more than CacheManager instance with the same key as these bite each other In the example down here the manager is created as a Singleton but you could also use for example Provider to Provide a CacheManager on the top level of your app Below is an example with other settings for the maximum age of files maximum number of objects and a custom FileService The key parameter in the constructor is mandatory all other variables are optional class CustomCacheManager static const key static CacheManager instance CacheManager Config key stalePeriod const Duration days maxNrOfCacheObjects repo JsonCacheInfoRepository databaseName key fileSystem IOFileSystem key fileService HttpFileService Frequently Asked Questions How are the cache files stored When are the cached files updated When are cached files removed How are the cache files stored By default the cached files are stored in the temporary directory of the app This means the OS can delete the files any time Information about the files is stored in a database using sqflite on Android iOS and macOs or in a plain JSON file on other platforms The file name of the database is the key of the cacheManager that why that has to be unique When are the cached files updated A valid url response should contain a header More info on the header can be found here but in summary it says for how long the image can be expected to be up to date It also contains an which can be used to check after that time whether the file did change or if it is actually still valid When a file is in the cache that is always directly returned when calling getSingleFile or getFileStream After that the information is check if the file is actually still valid If the file is outdated according to the headers the manager tries to update the file and store the new one in the cache When you use getFileStream this updated file will also be returned in the stream When are cached files removed The files can be removed by the cache manager or by the operating system By default the files are stored in a cache folder which is sometimes cleaned for example on Android with an app update The cache manager uses variables to determine when to delete a file the maxNrOfCacheObjects and the stalePeriod The cache knows when files have been used latest When cleaning the cache which happens continuously the cache deletes files when there are too many ordered by last use and when files just have been used for longer than the stale period Breaking changes in There is no longer a need to extend on BaseCacheManager you can directly call the constructor The BaseCacheManager is now only an interface CacheManager is the implementation you can use directly The constructor now expects a Config object with some settings you were used to but some are slightly different For example the system where you want to store your files is not just a dictionary anymore but a FileSystem That way you have more freedom on where to store your files See the example in Customize cache manager for flutter Saves web files on the storages of the device and

Searching for packagesPackage scoring and pub pointsFlutter Using packagesDeveloping packages and pluginsPublishing a packageDart Using packagesPublishing a copied to clipboardPublished months ago Dart highly customizable typeahead autocomplete text input field for FlutterMore ReadmeChangelogExampleInstallingVersionsScores Flutter TypeAhead A TypeAhead autocomplete widget for Flutter where you can show suggestions to users as they type Features Shows suggestions in an floating box with the same width as your TextField Allows controlling all aspects suggestions loading errors empty animation decoration layout etc Comes in both Material and Cupertino widget flavors For installation see installation instructions Usage You can import the package with import The package comes in both Material and Cupertino widget flavors All parameters identical the only changes are the visual defaults Basic TypeAheadField City suggestionsCallback search context search builder context controller focusNode return TextField controller controller focusNode focusNode autofocus true decoration InputDecoration border OutlineInputBorder labelText itemBuilder context city return ListTile title Text subtitle Text onSelected city context void MaterialPageRoute builder context CityPage city city Customizing the layout By default TypeAhead uses a ListView to render the items created by itemBuilder You may specify a custom layout via the listBuilder property For example to use a GridView TypeAheadField listBuilder context children controller scrollContoller crossAxisCount crossAxisSpacing mainAxisSpacing shrinkWrap true reverse City context children children Note To inherit the correct ScrollController please do not set primary to false The suggestions box will automatically provide an ambient PrimaryScrollController Customizing the TextField The TypeAheadField will use a simple default TextField builder if none is provided To customize your TextField you can use the builder property You may also use a TextFormField or any other widget that connects to a TextEditingController and FocusNode TypeAheadField builder context controller focusNode return TextField controller controller focusNode focusNode obscureText true decoration InputDecoration border OutlineInputBorder borderRadius labelText It is crucial that you use the provided controller and focusNode properties as they are required for the suggestions box to function Customizing the suggestions box The TypeAheadField will use a simple default decoration builder To customize the suggestions box you can create your own decoration builder You may also specify offsets and constraints to position the suggestions box TypeAheadField decorationBuilder context child return Material type elevation borderRadius child child offset Offset constraints BoxConstraints maxHeight Customizing the loading error and empty message You can use the loadingBuilder errorBuilder and emptyBuilder to customize their corresponding widgets For example TypeAheadField loadingBuilder context const Text errorBuilder context error const Text emptyBuilder context const Text items found By default the suggestions box will maintain the old suggestions while new suggestions are being retrieved To show a circular progress indicator during retrieval instead set keepSuggestionsOnLoading to false Hiding the suggestions box You may want to hide the suggestions box when it is in certain states You can do so with the following parameters hideOnLoading Hide the suggestions box while suggestions are being retrieved This ignores the loadingBuilder hideOnEmpty Hide the suggestions box when there are no suggestions This ignores the emptyBuilder hideOnError Hide the suggestions box when there is an error retrieving suggestions This ignores the errorBuilder hideOnSelect Hide the suggestions box when a suggestion is selected True by default hideOnUnfocus Hide the suggestions box when the TextField loses focus True by default hideWithKeyboard Hide the suggestions box when the keyboard is hidden True by default You can also very generally hide the suggestions box by returning null from the suggestionsCallback This is different from returning an empty list which will show the empty widget Customizing the animation Animation duration can be customized using the animationDuration parameter You may also specify a custom animation using the transitionBuilder parameter For example TypeAheadField transitionBuilder context animation child return FadeTransition opacity CurvedAnimation parent animation curve child child To disable animatons return the child directly Customizing the debounce duration The suggestions box does not fire for each character the user types Instead we wait until the user is idle for a duration of time and then call the suggestionsCallback The duration defaults to milliseconds but can be configured using the debounceDuration parameter Customizing the direction By default the list grows towards the bottom However you can use the direction to specify either or The suggestions list will automatically reverse in case it is flipped To turn off this behavior set autoFlipDirection to false Controlling the suggestions box You may manually control many aspects of the suggestions box by using the SuggestionsController class It grants access to the following the current suggestions the current loading state the current error the state the desired and effective direction the stream of selected suggestions the callback to trigger a resize When building a widget inside of the suggestions box you can access the controller via context Controlling the focus Focus plays an important role in the suggestions box It is used to determine when to show and hide the suggestions box However in certain situations you may want to control the suggestions box independently of the focus Options to do so are as follows On the TypeAheadField showOnFocus default true Show the suggestions box when the TextField gains focus hideOnUnfocus default true Hide the suggestions box when the TextField loses focus On the SuggestionsController open gainFocus false Show the suggestions box without focusing it close retainFocus true Hide the suggestions box without unfocusing it Customizing everything To create your own version of the TypeAhead widget that is neither Material nor Cupertino you can use the RawTypeAheadField widget You must then specify the following parameters builder to build the TextField loadingBuilder to build the loading widget errorBuilder to build the error widget emptyBuilder to build the empty widget itemBuilder to build the suggestions As well as all the usual parameters such as suggestionsCallback onSelected etc The decorationBuilder can be used to inject required wrappers like Material or DefaultTextStyle For more information see the source code of the TypeAheadField widget FAQ My suggestions arent changing when I type You have most likely forgotten to pass the controller and focus node to the TextField in the builder property This is required for the suggestions box to function Here is an example TypeAheadField controller myTextEditingController your custom controller or null builder context controller focusNode return TextField controller controller note how the controller is passed focusNode focusNode My suggestions are not updating when I click on the TextField The TypeAhead field caches the suggestions to avoid unnecessary calls to the suggestionsCallback If you want to force the suggestions to update you can use the SuggestionsController to force a refresh Migrations From to Since version the package is based on Dart enforced To use this package please upgrade your Flutter SDK Additionally various changes have been made to the API surface to make the package more flexible and customizable The following changes have been made SuggestionsBoxDecoration has been removed You can now directly wrap the SuggestionsBox with any widget you wish via the decorationBuilder property TextFieldConfiguration has been removed You can now directly build your own custom TextField via the builder property Note that you must use the provided controller and focusNode properties as they are required for the suggestions box to function SuggestionsBoxController has been renamed to SuggestionsController CupertinoSuggestionsBoxController has been merged into SuggestionsController SuggestionsController now holds the full state of the suggestions box meaning suggestions loading and error state It will also send notifications when state changes occur SuggestionsController now offers streams for when a suggestion is selected SuggestionsBox should now automatically resize in all situations Manual resize calls are no longer required TypeAheadFormField has been removed You can use the builder property to build your own TextFormField Various parameters have been renamed to be shorter and more concise Notable changes include suggestionsBoxController suggestionsController layoutArchitecture listBuilder emptyBuilder onSuggestionSelected onSelected suggestionsBoxVerticalOffset offset now also includes horizontal offset hideSuggestionsOnKeyboardHide hideWithKeyboard keepSuggestionsOnSuggestionSelected hideOnSelect inverted retainOnLoading Some parameters have been removed intercepting This is now always true since it doesnt interfere on mobile platforms and generally has no downsides onSuggestionsBoxToggle You can subscribe to the SuggestionsController to get notified when the suggestions box is toggled ignoreAccessibleNavigation The new Overlay code no longer requires to act differently when accessibility is enabled minCharsForSuggestions You can return an empty list from suggestionsCallback instead animationStart You can use the animation in the builder and map it to customise this autoFlipListDirection This is now always true You can use the list builder to disable this behavior getImmediateSuggestions You can use the debounceDuration to achieve the same effect From to Since version the package is based on Dart Flutter now also features the inbuilt Autocomplete

following code triggers the Review prompt This should not be used frequently as the underlying API enforce strict quotas on this feature to provide a great user experience import final InAppReview inAppReview if await Do Use this after a user has experienced your app for long enough to provide useful feedback after the completion of a game level or after a few days Use this sparingly otherwise no pop up will appear Avoid Triggering this via a button in your app as it will only work when the quota enforced by the underlying API has not been exceeded Android Interrupting the user if they are mid way through a task Testing requestReview on Android is as simple as running your app via the emulator or a physical device See Testing for more info openStoreListing The following code opens the Google Play Store on Android the App Store with a review screen on iOS MacOS and the Microsoft Store on Windows Use this if you want to permanently provide a button or other to let users leave a review as it is restricted by a quota import final InAppReview inAppReview appStoreId microsoftStoreId appStoreId is only required on iOS and MacOS and can be found in App Store Connect under General App Information Apple ID microsoftStoreId is only required on Windows Guidelines https https https Since there is a quota on how many times the pop up can be shown you should not trigger requestReview via a button or other option Instead you can reliably redirect users to your store listing via openStoreListing Testing read carefully Android You must upload your app to the Play Store to test requestReview The recommended approach is to build an app bundle and upload it via internal app sharing Real reviews can only be created when requestReview is used from the production track The submit button is disabled on other tracks and in internal app sharing to emphasize this If you get stuck here as many developers have please refer to the troubleshooting table found below or the complete official instructions Troubleshooting table Issue Solution Your app is not published yet in the Play Store Your app does have to be published to test but your app applicationID must be available at least in the internal testing track The user account ca review the app Your app must be in the user Google Play library To add your app to the user library download your app from the Play Store using that user account The primary account is not selected in the Play Store When multiple accounts are available in the device ensure that the primary account is the one selected in the Play Store The user account is protected for example with enterprise accounts Use a Gmail account instead The user has already reviewed the app Delete the review directly from Play Store The quota has been reached Use an internal test track or internal app sharing There is an issue with the Google Play Store or Google Play Services on the device This commonly occurs when the Play Store was sideloaded onto the device Use a different device that has a valid version of the Play Store and Google Play Services iOS requestReview can be tested via the iOS simulator or on a physical device Note that requestReview will do nothing when testing via TestFlight as documented Similarly to Android real reviews can only created when requestReview is used in production The submit button is disabled when testing locally to emphasize this openStoreListing can only be tested with a physical device as the iOS simulator does not have the App Store installed MacOS This plugin can be tested by running your MacOS application locally Cross Platform Compatibility Function Android iOS MacOS Windows isAvailable requestReview openStoreListing Requirements Android Requires Android Lollipop API or higher and the

value types EnumClass classes that behave like enums JSON serialization Immutable collections are from See the API docs Articles for Immutable Object Models for Serialization Building a Chat App in Dart End to End Testing in One Short Second with Dart Moving Fast with Dart Immutable Values Flutter JSON Serialization Flutter TODO App Example using and Building a large Flutter app with Redux Some Options for Deserializing JSON with Flutter Tutorials Custom Serializers Flutter Reddit Tutorial video source code Tools Json to Dart class converter Json or js Object to Dart class converter VSCode extension IntelliJ plugin Examples For an end to end example see the chat example which was demoed at the Dart Summit The data model used both client and server side uses value types enums and serialization from Simple examples are here Since codegen is triggered by running pub run build to do a build or pub run watch to continuously watch your source and update the generated output when it changes Note that you need a dev dependency on and See the example If using Flutter the equivalent command is flutter packages pub run build Alternatively put your classes in a separate Dart package with no dependency on Flutter You can then use as normal If using a version before codegen is triggered via either a to do a build or a to continuously watch your source and update generated output Value Types Value types are for our purposes classes that are considered interchangeable if their fields have the same values Common examples include Date Money and Url Most code introduces its own value types For example every web app probably has some version of Account and User Value types are very commonly sent by RPC stored for later retrieval The problems that led to the creation of the Built Value library have been discussed at great length in the context of AutoValue for Java In short creating and maintaining value types by hand requires a lot of boilerplate It boring to write and if you make a mistake you very likely create a bug that hard to track down Any solution for value types needs to allow them to participate in object oriented design Date for example is the right place for code that does simple date manipulation AutoValue solves the problem for Java with code generation and Built Values does the same for Dart The boilerplate is generated for you leaving you to specify which fields you need and to add code for the behaviour of the class Generating boilerplate for Value Types Value types require a bit of boilerplate in order to connect it to generated code Luckily even this bit of boilerplate can be automated using code snippets support in your favourite text editor For example in IntelliJ you can use the following live template abstract class implements Built Builder factory void Function Builder updates Using this template you would only have to manually enter a name for your data class which is something that ca be automated Enum Class Enum Classes provide classes with enum features Enums are very helpful in modelling the real world whenever there are a small fixed set of options an enum is a natural choice For an object oriented design though enums need to be classes Dart falls short here so Enum Classes provide what missing Design Constants have name and toString can be used in switch statements and are real classes that can hold code and implement interfaces Generated values method that returns all the enum values in a BuiltSet immutable set Generated valueOf method that takes a String Serialization Built Values comes with JSON serialization support which allows you to serialize a complete data model of Built Values Enum Classes and Built Collections The chat example shows how easy this makes building a full application with Dart on the server and client Here are the major features of the serialization support It fully supports object oriented design any object model that you can design can be serialized including full use of generics and interfaces Some other libraries require concrete types or do not fully support generics It allows different object oriented models over the same data For example in a client server application it likely that the client and server want different functionality from their data model So they are allowed to have different classes that map to the same data Most other libraries enforce a mapping between classes and types on the wire It requires well behaved types They must be immutable can use interface but not concrete inheritance must have predictable nullability hashCode equals and toString In fact they must be Enum Classes Built Collections or Built Values Some other libraries allow badly behaved types to be serialized It supports changes to the data model Optional fields can be added or removed and fields can be switched from optional to required allowing your data model to evolve without breaking compatbility Some other libraries break compatibility on any change to any serializable class It modular Each endpoint can choose which classes to know about for example you can have multiple clients that each know about only a subset of the classes the server knows Most other libraries are monolithic requiring all endpoints to know all types It has first class support for validation via Built Values An important part of a powerful data model is ensuring it valid so classes can make guarantees about what they can do Other libraries also support validation but usually in a less prominent way It pluggable You can add serializers for your own types and you can add plugins which run before and after all serializers This could be used to interoperate with other tools or to add hand coded high performance serializers for specific classes Some other libraries are not so extensible It was designed to be multi language mapping to equivalent object models in Java and other languages Currently only Dart is supported The need for other languages did materialize as servers are typically either written in Dart or owned by third parties Please open an issue if you like to explore support in more languages Common Usage While full compiled examples are available in a common usage example is shown here This example assumes that you are writing a client for a JSON API representing a person that looks like the following id age Jimmy hobbies jumping basketball The corresponding dart class employing might look like this Note that it is using the nullable annotation to indicate that the field does not have to be present on the response as well as the BuiltValueField annotation to map between the property name on the response and the name of the member variable in the Person class import import import part abstract class Person implements Built Person PersonBuilder static Serializer Person get serializer personSerializer Can never be null int get id nullable int get age nullable BuiltValueField wireName String get firstName nullable BuiltList String get hobbies factory Person void Function PersonBuilder updates Person FAQ How do I check a field is valid on instantiation The value class private constructor runs when all fields are initialized and can do arbitrary checks abstract class MyValue if field throw ArgumentError field not be negative How do I process a field on instantiation Add a hook that runs immediately before a builder is built For example you could sort a list so it always sorted directly before the value is created abstract class MyValue BuiltValueHook finalizeBuilder true static void

prompting users to upgrade when there is a newer version of the app in the store Overview When a newer app version is available in the app store a simple alert prompt or card is displayed With today modern app stores there is little need to persuade users to upgrade their apps because most are already using the auto upgrade feature However there may be times when an app needs to be updated more quickly than usual and nagging a user to upgrade will entice the upgrade sooner Also with Flutter supporting more than just Android and iOS platforms it will become more likely that users on other app stores need to be nagged about upgrading Platform Support Platform Automatically Supported Appcast Supported ANDROID Yes Yes IOS Yes Yes LINUX No Yes MACOS No Yes WEB No Yes WINDOWS No Yes Widgets The widgets come in two flavors alert or card The UpgradeAlert widget is used to display the popup alert prompt and the UpgradeCard widget is used to display the inline material design card There are three buttons displayed to the user IGNORE LATER and UPDATE NOW Tapping IGNORE prevents the alert from being displayed again for that version Tapping the LATER button just closes the alert allowing the alert to be displayed sometime in the future Tapping the UPDATE NOW button takes the user to the App Store iOS or Google Play Store Android where the user is expected to initiate the update process Alert Example Just wrap your home widget in the UpgradeAlert widget and it will handle the rest class MyApp extends StatelessWidget const MyApp override Widget build BuildContext context return MaterialApp title Example home UpgradeAlert child Scaffold appBar AppBar title Text Example body Center child Text Screenshot of alert Cupertino alert example You can also display a Cupertino style dialog by using the dialogStyle parameter body UpgradeAlert dialogStyle child Center child Text Screenshot of Cupertino alert Card Example Just return an UpgradeCard widget in your build method and a material design card will be displayed when an update is detected The widget will have width and height of when no update is detected return Container margin child UpgradeCard Screenshot of card Localization The text displayed in the upgrader package is localized in many languages and supports customization Release Notes The release notes are displayed by default when a new version is available On Android the release notes are taken from the the WHAT NEW section on Google Play when available otherwise the main app description is used On iOS the release notes are taken from the App Store What New section For appcast the release notes are taken from the description field Customization The alert can be customized by changing the DialogTheme on the MaterialApp or by overriding methods in the UpgradeAlert class See these examples for more details The card can be customized by changing the CardTheme on the MaterialApp or by overriding methods in the UpgradeCard class See

storeController UpgraderStoreController onAndroid UpgraderPlayStore oniOS UpgraderAppcastStore appcastURL appcastURL You can even subclass UpgraderStore or an existing store class like UpgraderPlayStore to provide your own customization Minimum App Version The upgrader package can enforce a minimum app version simply by adding a version number to the description field in the app stores For the Android Play Store use this format Minimum supported app version For the iOS App Store use this format mav Using that text says that the minimum app version is and that earlier versions of this app will be forced to update to the current version The Ignore and Later buttons will automatically be hidden After the app containing this text has been submitted for review approved and released on the app store the version number will be visible to the upgrader package When the minimum app version is updated in the future all previously installed apps with this package will recognize and honor that value This overrides any value supplied in the minAppVersion parameter Android Add this text to the bottom of the full description field in the Google Play Console under the main store listing iOS Add this text to the bottom of the description field in App Store Connect in the description field Go Router When using GoRouter package with upgrader you may need to provide a navigatorKey to the UpgradeAlert widget so that the correct route context is used Below is part of the code you will need for this Also checkout the example for a more complete example override Widget build BuildContext context return title GoRouter Example routerConfig routerConfig builder context child return UpgradeAlert navigatorKey child child Text Android Back Button When using the UpgradeAlert widget the Android back button will not dismiss the alert dialog by default To allow the back button to dismiss the dialog use shouldPopScope and return true like this UpgradeAlert shouldPopScope true Country Code On iOS when your app is not in the US App Store which is the default you must use the countryCode parameter mentioned above The upgrader package does not know which country app store to use because it is not provided by iOS It assumes the app is in the US App Store On Android the upgrader package uses the system locale to determine the country code Android Language Code Android description and release notes language default to en Limitations These widgets work on both Android and iOS When running on Android the Google Play Store will provide the latest app version When running on iOS the App Store will provide the latest app version In all cases the widget will display the prompt at the appropriate times On Android the version number is often not available from the Google Play Store such as with the Google Maps app In this case the version is listed as Varies with device That is not a valid version for upgrader and can not be used The upgrader widget will not be displayed in this case There is an appcast that can be used to remotely configure the latest app version See appcast below for more details Appcast The upgrader package supports Appcast as an UpgraderStore An appcast is an RSS feed with one channel that has a collection of items that each describe one app version The appcast will describe each app version and will provide the latest app version to upgrader that indicates when an upgrade should be recommended Appcast is based on the Sparkle framework by Andy Matuschak You can read the Sparkle documentation here https The appcast must be hosted on a server that can be reached by everyone from the app The appcast XML file can be autogenerated during the release process or just manually updated after a release is available on the app store The class UpgraderAppcastStore in this Flutter package is used by upgrader to download app details from an appcast Appcast Example This is an Appcast example for Android static const appcastURL final upgrader Upgrader storeController UpgraderStoreController onAndroid UpgraderAppcastStore appcastURL appcastURL override Widget build BuildContext context return

Now App Appcast item title Version description Minor updates and pubDate Sun Dec enclosure https sparkle sparkle android Appcast Class final appcast Appcast final items await final bestItem Customizing the strings The strings displayed in upgrader can be customzied by extending the UpgraderMessages class to provide custom values As an example to replace the Ignore button with a custom value first create a new class that extends UpgraderMessages and override the buttonTitleIgnore function Next when calling UpgradeAlert or UpgradeCard add the parameter messages with an instance of your extended class Here is an example class MyUpgraderMessages extends UpgraderMessages override String get buttonTitleIgnore Ignore UpgradeAlert Upgrader messages MyUpgraderMessages Language localization The strings displayed in upgrader are already localized in languages New languages will be supported in the future with minor updates It also supports right to left languages Languages supported English Arabic Bengali Chinese Danish Dutch Filipino French German Greek Haitian Creole Hebrew Hindi Hungarian Indonesian Italian Japanese Kazakh Khmer Korean Lithuanian Mongolian Norwegian Persian Polish Portuguese Russian Spanish Swedish Tamil Telugu Turkish Ukrainian Vietnamese The upgrader package can be supplied with additional languages in your code by extending the UpgraderMessages class to provide custom values As an example to add the Spanish es language which is already provided first create a new class that extends UpgraderMessages and override the message function Next add a string for each of the messages Finally when calling UpgradeAlert or UpgradeCard add the parameter messages with an instance of your extended class Here is an example class MySpanishMessages extends UpgraderMessages Override the message function to provide custom language localization override String message UpgraderMessage messageKey if languageCode switch messageKey case return A new version of appName is available case return Ignore case return Later case return Update Now case return Want to update case return Release Notes case return Update App Messages that are not provided above can still use the default values return messageKey UpgradeAlert upgrader Upgrader messages MySpanishMessages You can even force the upgrader package to use a specific language instead of the system language on the device Just pass the language code to an instance of UpgraderMessages when displaying the alert or card Here is an example UpgradeAlert upgrader Upgrader messages UpgraderMessages code Semantic Versioning The upgrader package uses the version package that is in compliance with the Semantic Versioning spec at http It converts any version string to a digit version For versions that only use digit MAJOR it converts it to a digit version and for versions that only use digits it converts it to a digit version to be compliant with Semantic Versioning Examples There are plenty of examples that cover various different situations that may help you customize the upgrader experience for your app Check these out iTunes Search API There is a class in this Flutter package used by the upgrader widgets to download app details from the iTunes Search API The class ITunesSearchAPI can be used standalone to query iTunes for app details ITunesSearchAPI

Flutter plugin for purchases Exposes APIs for making purchases through the App Store and Google ReadmeChangelogExampleInstallingVersionsScoresA API for purchases in Flutter apps This plugin supports purchases IAP through an underlying store which can be the App Store on iOS and macOS or Google Play on Android Android iOS macOS Support SDK Features Use this plugin in your Flutter app to Show products that are available for sale from the underlying store Products can include consumables permanent upgrades and subscriptions Load products that the user owns Send the user to the underlying store to purchase products Present a UI for redeeming subscription offer codes iOS only Getting started This plugin relies on the App Store and Google Play for making purchases It exposes a unified surface but you still need to understand and configure your app with each store Both stores have extensive guides App Store documentation Google Play documentation NOTE Further in this document the App Store and Google Play will be referred to as the store or the underlying store except when a feature is specific to a particular store For a list of steps for configuring purchases in both stores see the example app README Once you configured your purchases in their respective stores you can start using the plugin Two basic options are available A generic idiomatic Flutter API This API supports most use cases for loading and making purchases Dart APIs and These APIs expose behavior and allow for more control when needed However if you use one of these APIs your logic is significantly different for the different storefronts See also the codelab for purchases in Flutter for a detailed guide on adding purchase support to a Flutter App Usage This section has examples of code for the following tasks Listening to purchase updates Connecting to the underlying store Loading products for sale Restoring previous purchases Making a purchase Completing a purchase Upgrading or downgrading an existing subscription Accessing platform specific product or purchase properties Presenting a code redemption sheet iOS Note It is not necessary to depend on billing in your own app file If you choose to do so know that conflicts might occur Listening to purchase updates In your app initState method subscribe to any incoming purchases These can propagate from either underlying store You should always start listening to purchase update as early as possible to be able to catch all purchase updates including the ones from the previous app session To listen to the update class extends State MyApp StreamSubscription List PurchaseDetails override void initState final Stream purchaseUpdated purchaseDetailsList purchaseDetailsList onDone onError error handle error here override void dispose Here is an example of how to handle purchase updates void List PurchaseDetails purchaseDetailsList PurchaseDetails purchaseDetails async if else if else if bool valid await purchaseDetails if valid purchaseDetails else purchaseDetails if await purchaseDetails Connecting to the underlying store final bool available await if available The store can not be reached or accessed Update the UI Loading products for sale Set literals require Dart Alternatively use Set String String const Set String String final ProductDetailsResponse response await if Handle the List ProductDetails products Restoring previous purchases Restored purchases will be emitted on the make sure to validate restored purchases following the best practices for each underlying store Verifying App Store purchases Verifying Google Play purchases await Note that the App Store does not have any APIs for querying consumable products and Google Play considers consumable products to no longer be owned once they marked as consumed and fails to return them here For restoring these across devices you need to persist them on your own server and query that as well Making a purchase Both underlying stores handle consumable and products differently If you using InAppPurchase you need to make a distinction here and call the right purchase method for each type final ProductDetails productDetails Saved earlier from queryProductDetails final PurchaseParam purchaseParam PurchaseParam productDetails productDetails if productDetails purchaseParam purchaseParam else purchaseParam purchaseParam From here the purchase flow will be handled by the underlying store Updates will be delivered to the Completing a purchase The will send purchase updates after initiating the purchase flow using or After verifying the purchase receipt and the delivering the content to the user it is important to call to tell the underlying store that the purchase has been completed Calling will inform the underlying store that the app verified and processed the purchase and the store can proceed to finalize the transaction and bill the end user payment account Warning Failure to call and get a successful response within days of the purchase will result a refund Upgrading or downgrading an existing subscription To an existing subscription in Google Play you need to provide an instance of ChangeSubscriptionParam with the old PurchaseDetails that the user needs to migrate from and an optional ProrationMode with the GooglePlayPurchaseParam object while calling The App Store does not require this because it provides a subscription grouping mechanism Each subscription you offer must be assigned to a subscription group Grouping related subscriptions together can help prevent users from accidentally purchasing multiple subscriptions Refer to the Creating a Subscription Group section of Apple subscription guide final PurchaseDetails oldPurchaseDetails PurchaseParam purchaseParam GooglePlayPurchaseParam productDetails productDetails changeSubscriptionParam ChangeSubscriptionParam oldPurchaseDetails oldPurchaseDetails prorationMode purchaseParam purchaseParam Confirming subscription price changes When the price of a subscription is changed the consumer will need to confirm that price change If the consumer does not confirm the price change the subscription will not be By default on both iOS and Android the consumer will automatically get a popup to confirm the price change Depending on the platform there are different ways to interact with this flow as explained in the following paragraphs Google Play Store Android When changing the price of an existing subscription base plan or offer existing subscribers are placed in a legacy price cohort App developers can choose to end a legacy price cohort and move subscribers into the current base plan price When the new subscription base plan price is lower Google will notify the consumer via email and notifications The consumer will start paying the lower price next time they pay for their base plan When the subscription price is raised Google will automatically start notifying consumers through email and notifications days after the legacy price cohort was ended It is highly recommended to give consumers advanced notice of the price change and provide a deep link to the Play Store subscription screen to help them review the price change The official documentation can be found here Apple App Store iOS When the price of a subscription is raised iOS will also show a popup in the app The StoreKit Payment Queue will notify the app that it wants to show a price change confirmation popup By default the queue will get the response that it can continue and show the popup However it is possible to prevent this popup via the and show the popup at a different time for example after clicking a button To know when the App Store wants to show a popup and prevent this from happening a queue delegate can be registered The InAppPurchaseStoreKitPlatformAddition contains a setDelegate SKPaymentQueueDelegateWrapper delegate function that can be used to set a delegate or remove one by setting it to null for InAppPurchaseStoreKitPlatformAddition import Future void initStoreInfo async if var iosPlatformAddition InAppPurchaseStoreKitPlatformAddition await ExamplePaymentQueueDelegate override Future void disposeStore if var iosPlatformAddition InAppPurchaseStoreKitPlatformAddition await null The delegate that is set should implement SKPaymentQueueDelegateWrapper and handle shouldContinueTransaction and shouldShowPriceConsent When setting shouldShowPriceConsent to false the default popup will not be shown and the app needs to show this later import for SKPaymentQueueDelegateWrapper import class ExamplePaymentQueueDelegate implements SKPaymentQueueDelegateWrapper override bool shouldContinueTransaction SKPaymentTransactionWrapper transaction SKStorefrontWrapper storefront return true override bool shouldShowPriceConsent return false The dialog can be shown by calling showPriceConsentIfNeeded on the InAppPurchaseStoreKitPlatformAddition This future will complete immediately when the dialog is shown A confirmed transaction will be delivered on the purchaseStream if var iapStoreKitPlatformAddition InAppPurchaseStoreKitPlatformAddition await Accessing platform specific product or purchase properties The function productIds provides a ProductDetailsResponse with a list of purchasable products of type List ProductDetails This ProductDetails class is a platform independent class containing properties only available on all endorsed platforms However in some cases it is necessary to access platform specific properties The ProductDetails instance is of subtype GooglePlayProductDetails when the platform is Android and AppStoreProductDetails on iOS Accessing the skuDetails on Android or the skProduct on iOS provides all the information that is available in the original platform objects This is an example on how to get the introductoryPricePeriod on Android for GooglePlayProductDetails import for SkuDetailsWrapper import if productDetails is GooglePlayProductDetails SkuDetailsWrapper skuDetails productDetails as GooglePlayProductDetails print And this is the way to get the subscriptionGroupIdentifier of a subscription on iOS for AppStoreProductDetails import for SKProductWrapper import if productDetails is AppStoreProductDetails SKProductWrapper skProduct productDetails as AppStoreProductDetails print The purchaseStream provides objects of type PurchaseDetails PurchaseDetails provides all information that is available on all endorsed platforms such as purchaseID and transactionDate In addition it is possible to access the platform specific properties The PurchaseDetails object is of subtype GooglePlayPurchaseDetails when the platform is Android and AppStorePurchaseDetails on iOS Accessing the billingClientPurchase resp skPaymentTransaction provides all the information that is available in the original platform objects This is an example on how to get the originalJson on Android for GooglePlayPurchaseDetails import for PurchaseWrapper import if purchaseDetails is GooglePlayPurchaseDetails PurchaseWrapper billingClientPurchase purchaseDetails as GooglePlayPurchaseDetails print How to get the transactionState of a purchase in iOS for AppStorePurchaseDetails import for SKProductWrapper import if purchaseDetails is AppStorePurchaseDetails SKPaymentTransactionWrapper skProduct

symbol Android Foreground Services Optional IMPORTANT Foreground Services behaviour on platforms other than Android Main Philosophy of Awesome Notifications At Awesome Notifications we prioritize making notification implementation both straightforward and This approach allows developers to concentrate on content creation rather than the technical challenges posed by the diverse capabilities of different devices Our philosophy is to make full use of all available notification features on a device while seamlessly omitting those that are not supported Key aspects of our philosophy include Consistent Delivery We ensure that all notifications sent while the app is inactive are recorded and delivered promptly after the app restarts and listener setups are complete Adaptation We automatically ignore features LED lights when they are not available adapting notifications to each device capabilities Notification Channels We strive to emulate Android channel configuration behavior in iOS devices providing a familiar and intuitive experience across platforms App Badge Management We strive to emulate iOS approach to app badge manipulation as closely as possible on all other platforms By adhering to these principles Awesome Notifications is committed to delivering a seamless and consistent notification experience across various devices thereby enhancing user engagement with your application Getting Started Initial Configurations To use the follow these steps Add the plugin to your project file dependencies always ensure to use the latest version any this version is managed by package After adding the dependency run the following command to get the package flutter pub get Now you need to modify some files in native libraries to meet to use properly Let start with the Android configurations Configuring Android for Awesome Notifications Is required the minimum android SDK to Android Lollipop Grade or greater and Java compiled SDK Version to Android You can change the minSdkVersion to and the compileSdkVersion and targetSdkVersion to inside the file located inside folder buildscript dependencies classpath android compileSdkVersion defaultConfig minSdkVersion targetSdkVersion In the app s file which can be found in the directory of your Flutter project add the following permissions manifest xmlns http application android android If you using any activity service or receiver components with declared inside add the attribute android true to make them accessible from outside the app context manifest xmlns http application activity android android true Configuring iOS for Awesome Notifications To ensure that Awesome Notifications is correctly configured with your iOS app you need to modify your Podfile within the iOS folder This involves adding specific blocks for Awesome Notifications pod modifications at the end of the section and immediately following it Original Podfile Configuration do do target end end Modified Podfile with Awesome Notifications Configurations do do target end Awesome Notifications pod modification require installer Awesome Notifications pod modification end Awesome Notifications pod modification require Awesome Notifications pod modification Key Points The first modification block updates the pod settings The second modification block updates the settings of the main project target The blocks are not equal The first one calls and the second one calls Also the modifications are clearly marked with Awesome Notifications pod modification comments for easy identification These additions ensure that Awesome Notifications are properly integrated and configured within your iOS project Podfile How to show Local Notifications Add as a dependency in your file any Any attribute updates automatically your source to the last version import the plugin package to your dart code import Initialize the plugin on before MaterialApp widget preferentially inside main method with at least one

debug true Inside the MaterialApp widget create your named routes and set your global navigator key Also inside initState initialize your static listeners methods to capture notification actions OBS With the navigator key you can redirect pages and get context even inside static classes OBS Only after setListeners being called the notification events starts to be delivered class MyApp extends

arguments receivedAction Request the user authorization to send local and push notifications Remember to show a dialog alert to the user before call this request AwesomeNotifications isAllowed if isAllowed This is just a basic example For real apps you must show some friendly dialog box before call the request method This is very important to not harm the user experience AwesomeNotifications In any place of your app create a new notification with AwesomeNotifications content NotificationContent id channelKey actionType title World body is my first notification This will create a new notification with ID using the previously defined notification channel and the default action type that brings the app to foreground The notification will have a title of Hello World and a body of This is my first notification THATS IT CONGRATZ MY FRIEND Getting started Important notes You MUST initialize all Awesome Notifications plugins even if your app does not have permissions to send notifications In case you need to capture the user notification action before calling the method setListeners you can call the method getInitialNotificationAction at any moment In case your app was started by an user notification action getInitialNotificationAction will return the respective ActionReceived object Otherwise will return null OBS getInitialNotificationAction method does not affect the results from onActionReceivedMethod except if you set removeFromActionEvents to true void main async ReceivedAction receivedAction await AwesomeNotifications removeFromActionEvents false if receivedAction setInitialPageToCallPage else setInitialPageToHomePage In case you need to redirect the user after a silentAction or silentBackgroundAction event you may face the situation where you are running inside a dart Isolate with no valid BuildContext to redirect the user For such cases you can use SendPort and ReceivePort to switch execution between isolates First create a ReceivePort inside your initialization process which only occurs in the main isolate Then inside your onActionReceivedMethod check if you are running inside the main isolate first If not use a SendPort to send the execution to the listening ReceivePort Inside the ReceivePort listener you can then call the appropriate method to handle the background action Here is an example In the initialization of your Create a receive port ReceivePort port ReceivePort Register the receive port with a unique name port Listen for messages on the receive port var serializedData async print running on main isolate final receivedAction ReceivedAction serializedData receivedAction Set the initialization flag true In your onActionReceivedMethod method static Future void onActionReceivedMethod ReceivedAction received async print action received If the controller was not initialized or the function is not running in the main isolate try to retrieve the ReceivePort at main isolate and them send the execution to it if SendPort uiSendPort if uiSendPort null print action running on parallel isolate without valid context Redirecting execution return print running on background isolate await received static Future void ReceivedAction received async Here you handle your notification actions Navigate into pages avoiding to open the notification details page twice In case youre using some state management such as GetX or use them to get the valid context instead of using the Flutter navigator key route arguments receivedAction On Android if you press the back button until leaves the app and then reopen it using the Recent apps list THE LAST APP INITIALIZATION WILL BE REPEATED So in the case where the app was started up by a notification in this exclusive case the notification action will be repeated If this is not desirable behavior for your app you will need to handle this case specifically in your app logic Extra iOS Setup for Background Actions On iOS to use any plugin inside background actions you will need to manually register each plugin you want Otherwise you will face the MissingPluginException exception To avoid this you need to add the following lines to the file in your iOS project folder import Flutter import import override func application application UIApplication didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions Any Bool with self This function registers the desired plugins to be used within a notification background action registry in with forPlugin with forPlugin return application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions You can also check the file to see the correct plugin names to use Note that the plugin names may change over time Example Apps With the examples bellow you can check all the features and how to use the Awesome Notifications in pratice The Simple Example app contains the basic structure to use Awesome Notifications and the Complete Example App contains all Awesome Notification features to test To run and debug the Simple Example App follow the steps bellow Create a new Flutter project with at least Android or iOS Copy the example code at https Paste the content inside the file Debug the application with a real device or emulator To run and debug the Complete Example App follow the steps bellow Install GitHub software in your local machine I strongly recommend to use GitHub Desktop Go to one of our GitHub repositories Clone the project to your local machine Open the project with Android Studio or any other IDE Sync the project dependencies running flutter pub get On iOS run pod install inside the folder to sync the native dependencies Debug the application with a real device or emulator Awesome Notification Flowchart Notifications are received by local code or Push service using native code so the messages will appears immediately or at schedule time independent of your application is running or not Notification Events The notification events are only delivered after setListeners method being called and they are not always delivered at same time as they happen The awesome notifications event methods available to track your notifications are onNotificationCreatedMethod optional Fires when a notification is created onNotificationDisplayedMethod optional Fires when a notification is displayed on system status bar onActionReceivedMethod required Fires when a notification is tapped by the user onDismissedActionReceivedMethod optional Fires when a notification is dismissed by the user sometimes the OS denies the deliver and these are the delivery conditions Platform App in Foreground App in Background App Terminated Force Quit Android Fires all events immediately after occurs Fires all events immediately after occurs Store events to be fired when app is on Foreground or Background iOS Fires all events immediately after occurs Store events to be fired when app is on Foreground Store events to be fired when app is on Foreground Exception onActionReceivedMethod fires all events immediately after occurs in any application life cycle for all Platforms Notification Action Types There are several types of notification actions that you can use in Awesome Notifications Default This is the default action type It forces the app to go to the foreground when the user taps the notification SilentAction This type of action does not force the app to go to the foreground but it runs on the main thread and can accept visual elements It can be interrupted if the main app is terminated SilentBackgroundAction This type of action does not force the app to the foreground and runs in the background It does not accept any visual element and the execution is done on an exclusive Dart isolate KeepOnTop This type of action fires the respective action without closing the notification status bar and does not bring the app to the foreground DisabledAction When the user taps this type of action the notification simply closes itself on the tray without firing any action event DismissAction This type of action behaves the same way as a user dismissing action but it dismisses the respective notification and fires the onDismissActionReceivedMethod It ignores the autoDismissible property InputField Deprecated When the user taps this type of action it opens a dialog box that allows them to send a text response Now you can use the requireInputText property instead Remember that for silent types it is necessary to use the await keyword to prevent the isolates from shutting down before all the work is done Consider using these different types of actions to customize the behavior of your notifications to suit your needs Notification Category The notification category is a group of predefined categories that best describe the nature of the notification and may be used by some systems to rank delay or filter the notifications It highly recommended to always correctly categorize your notifications Alarm Alarm or timer Call incoming call voice or video or similar synchronous communication request Email asynchronous bulk message email Error error in background operation or authentication status Event calendar event LocalSharing temporarily sharing location Message incoming direct message SMS instant message MissedCall incoming call voice or video or similar synchronous communication request Navigation map navigation Progress progress of a background operation Promo promotion or advertisement Recommendation a specific timely recommendation for a single thing For example a news app might want to recommend a news story it believes the user will want to read next Reminder reminder Service indication of running background service Social social network or sharing update Status ongoing information about device or contextual status StopWatch running stopwatch Transport media transport control for playback Workout tracking a user workout Requesting Permissions Permissions give transparency to the user about what you intend to do with your app while it in use To show any notification on a device you must obtain the user consent Keep in mind that this consent can be revoked at any time on any platform On Android and below the basic permissions are always granted to any newly installed app But for iOS and Android and beyond even the basic permission must be requested from the user Disclaimer On Android revoke certain permissions including notification permissions may cause the system to automatically restart the app to ensure the new permission setting is respected Handle this scenario in your code by saving any necessary state before requesting or changing permissions and restoring that state when the app is restarted Inform your users about this behavior to avoid confusion and ensure a smoother user experience Permissions can be defined in three types Normal permissions These permissions are not considered dangerous and do not require explicit user consent to be enabled Execution permissions These permissions are considered more sensitive to the user and you must obtain their explicit consent to use them permissions These permissions can harm the user experience or their privacy and you must obtain their explicit consent Depending on the platform you may need permission from the manufacturer to use them As a good practice always check if the permissions you desire are granted before creating any new notification regardless of the platform To check if a permission requires explicit user consent call the method shouldShowRationaleToRequest The list of permissions that require a rationale to the user can differ between platforms and OS versions If your app does not require a permission to execute what you need consider not requesting it respecting the user will Notification Permissions Alert Alerts are notifications with high priority that pops up on the user screen Notifications with normal priority only shows the icon on status bar Sound Sound allows for the ability to play sounds for new displayed notifications The notification sounds are limited to a few seconds and if you plan to play a sound for more time you must consider to play a background sound to do it simultaneously with the notification Badge Badge is the ability to display a badge alert over the app icon to alert the user about updates The badges can be displayed on numbers or small dots depending of platform or what the user defined in the device settings Both Android and iOS can show numbers on badge depending of its version and distribution Light The ability to display colorful small lights blanking on the device while the screen is off to alert the user about updates Only a few Android devices have this feature Vibration The ability to vibrate the device to alert the user about updates FullScreenIntent The ability to show the notifications on pop up even if the user is using another app PreciseAlarms Precise alarms allows the scheduled notifications to be displayed at the expected time This permission can be revoke by special device modes such as battery save mode etc Some manufactures can disable this feature if they decide that your app is consumpting many computational resources and decressing the baterry life and without changing the permission status for your app So you must take in consideration that some schedules can be delayed or even not being displayed depending of what platform are you running You can increase the chances to display the notification at correct time enable this permission and setting the correct notification category but you never gon na have sure about it CriticalAlert Critical alerts is a special permission that allows to play sounds and vibrate for new notifications displayed even if the device is in Do Not Disturb Silent mode For iOS you must request Apple a authorization to your app use it OverrideDnD Override DnD allows the notification to decrease the Do Not Disturb Silent mode level enable to display critical alerts for Alarm and Call notifications For Android you must require the user consent to use it For iOS this permission is always enabled with CriticalAlert Provisional Only has effect on iOS The ability to display notifications temporarily without the user consent Car The ability to display notifications while the device is in car mode OBS If none permission is requested through requestPermissionToSendNotifications method the standard permissions requested are Alert Badge Sound Vibrate and Light Notification Permission Level A permission can be segregated in different levels Device level The permissions set at the global device configuration are applicable at any app installed on device such as all notifications battery save mode low power mode and silent do not disturb mode Application level The permissions set at the global app configurations are applicable to any notification in any channel Channel level The permissions set on the channel has effect only for notifications displayed through that specific channel Full example on how to request permissions Below is a complete example of how to check if the desired permission is enabled and how to request it by showing a dialog with a rationale if necessary this example is taken from our sample app static Future List NotificationPermission requestUserPermissions BuildContext context if you only intends to

channels Notification channels are a way to group notifications that share common characteristics such as the channel name description sound vibration LED light and importance level You can create and delete notification channels at any time in your app However at least one notification channel must exist during the initialization of the Awesome Notifications plugin If you create a notification using an invalid channel key the notification will be discarded In Android SDK and later versions you can not update notification channels after they are created except for the name and description attributes However for exceptional cases where you need to change your channels you can set the forceUpdate property to true in the setChannel method This option will delete the original channel and recreate it with a different native channel key But use it only in cases of extreme need because this method deviates from the standard defined by the Android team Note that this operation has the negative effect of automatically closing all active notifications on that channel For iOS there is no native notification channel concept However Awesome Notifications will handle your notification channels in the same way as Android so you only need to write your code once and it will work on both platforms You can also organize your notification channels visually in your Android app by using NotificationChannelGroup in the AwesomeNotifications method and the channelGroupKey property in the respective channels You can update the channel group name at any time but a channel can only be defined in a group when it is created The main methods to manipulate notification channels are AwesomeNotifications Creates or updates a notification channel AwesomeNotifications Removes a notification channel closing all current notifications on that channel You can use the following attributes to configure your notification channels Notification Channel Attributes Attribute Required Description Type Updatable Default Value channelKey Yes A string key that identifies a channel where notifications are sent String No channelName Yes The name of the channel which is visible to users on Android String Yes None channelDescription Yes A brief description of the channel which is visible to users on Android String Yes None channelShowBadge No Whether the notification should automatically increment the app icon badge counter Boolean Yes false channelGroupKey No A string key to group all channels in same topic at android configuration page String No None importance No The importance level of the notification NotificationImportance No Normal playSound No Whether the notification should play a sound Boolean No true soundSource No The path of a custom sound file to be played with the notification String No None defaultRingtoneType No The type of default sound to be played with the notification only for Android DefaultRingtoneType Yes Notification enableVibration No Whether the device should vibrate when the notification is received Boolean No true enableLights No Whether the device should display a blinking LED when the notification is received Boolean No true ledColor No The color of the LED to display when the notification is received Color No ledOnMs No The duration in milliseconds that the LED should remain on when displaying the notification Integer No None ledOffMs No The duration in milliseconds that the LED should remain off when displaying the notification Integer No None groupKey No The string key used to group notifications together in Android status bar String No None groupSort No The order in which notifications within a group should be sorted GroupSort No Desc groupAlertBehavior No The alert behavior to use for notifications within a group GroupAlertBehavior No All defaultPrivacy No The level of privacy to apply to the notification when the device is locked NotificationPrivacy No Private icon No The name of the notification icon to display in the status bar String No None defaultColor No The color to use for the notification on Android Color No locked No Whether the notification should be prevented from being dismissed by the user Boolean No false onlyAlertOnce No Whether the notification should only alert the user once Boolean No false Notification Channel Important Notes Notification channels can not be modified after being created on devices running Android SDK or later unless the app is reinstalled or installed for the first time after the changes In exceptional cases where modification is necessary you can set the forceUpdate property to true in the setChannel method to delete the original channel and recreate it with a different native channel key However this method should only be used when absolutely necessary as it deviates from the standard defined by the Android team Keep in mind that using forceUpdate will also close all active notifications on the channel Scheduling a Notification Notifications can be scheduled either from a UTC or local time zone and can be configured with a time interval or by setting a calendar filter Schedules can also be created remotely using silent push notifications Note for iOS users It is not possible to define the exact displayedDate for a notification on iOS as it is not possible due the impossibility to execute anything at same time as the scheduled time when it arrives in the user status bar To schedule a notification instantiate one of the classes below in the schedule property of the notification NotificationCalendar Creates a notification that is scheduled to be displayed when the set date components match the current date If a time component is set to null then any value is considered valid to produce the next valid date Only one value is allowed for each component NotificationInterval Creates a notification that is scheduled to be displayed at each interval time starting from the next valid interval NotificationAndroidCrontab Creates a notification that is scheduled to be displayed based on a list of precise dates or a crontab rule with seconds precision To learn more about how to create a valid crontab rule check out this article All of these classes can be configured with the following properties timeZone describes the time zone on which the schedule is based valid examples include UTC allowWhileIdle determines whether the notification will be sent even when the device is in a critical situation such as low battery repeats determines whether the schedule should repeat after the notification is displayed If there are no more valid dates compatible with the schedule rules the notification is automatically canceled Please note the following about time zones Dates with UTC time zones are triggered at the same time in all parts of the planet and are not affected by daylight rules Dates with local time zones defined such as are not affected by daylight rules Dates with local time zones defined such as are affected by daylight rules especially when scheduled based on a calendar filter Here are some practical examples of how to create a scheduled notification String

It important to keep in mind that schedules can be ignored or delayed especially for repeating schedules due to system algorithms designed to save battery life and prevent abuse of resources While this behavior is recommended to protect the app and the manufacturer image it crucial to consider this fact in your business logic However for cases where precise schedule execution is a must there are some features you can use to ensure the notification is sent at the correct time Set the notification category to a critical one such as Alarm Reminder or Call Set the preciseAlarm property to true This feature allows the system to schedule notifications to be sent at an exact time even if the device is in mode For Android versions greater than or equal to you need to explicitly request user consent to enable this feature You can request the permission with requestPermissionToSendNotifications or take the user to the permission page by calling showAlarmPage Set the criticalAlerts channel property and notification content property to true This feature allows you to show notifications and play sounds even when the device is on silent or Do Not Disturb mode Due to its sensitivity this feature requires special authorization from Apple on iOS and explicit user consent on Android versions greater than or equal to On iOS you must submit a request for authorization to Apple to enable it as described in this post To enable precise alarms you need to add the permission to your app file located in the folder manifest xmlns http android application For Android or greater the permission is denied by default and you must request it from the users using requestPermissionToSendNotifications To enable critical alerts you need to add the permission to your app file manifest xmlns http android application In summary if you need to ensure precise execution of scheduled notifications make sure to use the appropriate categories and properties for your notifications and enable the necessary permissions in your app manifest file Additionally you can ask your users to whitelist your app from any battery optimization feature that the device may have This can be done by adding your app to the unmonitored apps or battery optimization exceptions list depending on the device You can also try to use the package to help schedule background tasks This package allows you to schedule tasks that will run even when the app is not open and it has some features to help handle battery optimization To know more about it please visit documentation and Optimizing for Doze and App Standby for Android devices Schedule Notification Important Notes Schedules may be delayed or denied if the is in battery saver mode or locked to perform background tasks Educate your users on why it important to avoid these modes and the potential consequences of using them Also some battery saving modes may differ between manufacturers such as Samsung and Xiaomi which automatically enable battery saving mode for newly installed apps On iOS you can only schedule up to notifications per app On Android you can schedule up to notifications per app If you running your app in debug mode all schedules may be erased by the Android OS when you close the app This ensures consistent behavior when testing in debug mode To test schedule notifications on Android when the app is not running make sure to open the app without debugging If your app does require precise scheduling of notifications avoid requesting exact notifications to conserve battery life Categorize your notifications correctly to avoid scheduling delays Note that critical alerts are still under development and should not be used in production mode Deprecated Schedule Class for Cron Rules Versions Prior to Before version Awesome Notifications included the Schedule class which allowed users to schedule notifications based on cron tab rules However due to limitations with how background tasks and notification schedules work on iOS it was not possible to fully support schedules on iOS devices while the app is in the background or terminated As a result the NotificationAndroidCrontab class was introduced as an alternative for Android users to create complex schedules based on cron tab rules Unfortunately Apple has not yet resolved the limitations with schedules on iOS and there are no plans to support the deprecated Schedule class in future versions of Awesome Notifications A support ticket was opened for Apple in order to resolve this issue but they do even care about For more information and updates on this issue you can follow the progress of the support ticket here Translation of Notification Content The new NotificationLocalization class allows you to create a set of localized strings for a notification including the title body summary large icon big picture and button labels This feature makes it easy to provide localized content for your users which is essential for global applications To set the desired localization for notifications use the setLocalization method This method takes a required languageCode parameter which is an optional string that represents the language code for the desired localization For example you can set the language code to en for English for Brazilian Portuguese es for Spanish and so on If the localization was never set or redefined the default localization will be loaded from the device system await AwesomeNotifications languageCode To get the current localization code used by the plugin for notification content use the getLocalization method This method returns a string representing the current localization code which is a language code or a language code combined with a region code If no localization has been set this method will return the system default language code String currentLanguageCode await AwesomeNotifications Here an example of how to use the localizations parameter to translate notification content into several languages await AwesomeNotifications content NotificationContent id id channelKey title title is written in english body it is really easy to translate a notification content

can now set a chronometer and a timeout expiration time for your notifications The chronometer field is a Duration type that sets the showWhen attribute of Android notifications to the amount of seconds to start The timeoutAfter field also a Duration type determines an expiration time limit for the notification to stay in the system tray After this period the notification will automatically dismiss itself Both fields are optional and when used with JSON data should be positive integers representing the amount of seconds Here is how you can set the chronometer and timeoutAfter in your notifications await AwesomeNotifications content NotificationContent id id channelKey title with Chronometer and Timeout body notification will start with a chronometer and dismiss after seconds chronometer Chronometer starts to count at seconds timeoutAfter Duration seconds Notification dismisses after seconds Progress Bar Notifications Only for Android On Android you can display a progress bar notification to show the progress of an ongoing task To create a progress bar notification you need to set the notification layout to ProgressBar and specify the progress value between and or set it to indeterminate To update the progress of your notification you can create a new notification with the same ID However you should not update the notification more frequently than once per second as doing so may cause the notifications to be blocked by the operating system Here is an example of how to create a progress bar notification and update its progress int currentStep Timer Future void showProgressNotification int id async int maxStep int fragmentation for var simulatedStep simulatedStep maxStep fragmentation currentStep simulatedStep await Duration milliseconds fragmentation if null continue Timer const Duration seconds id id simulatedStep currentStep maxStep maxStep fragmentation null void required int id required int simulatedStep required int maxStep if simulatedStep

NotificationContent id id channelKey title fake file in progress progress body category payload c notificationLayout progress progress locked true Note that in this example the showProgressNotification function creates a loop to simulate progress by delaying a fixed amount of time between each simulated step The function is called at a frequency of one call per second and updates the progress value of the notification The locked parameter is set to true to prevent the user from dismissing the notification while the progress bar is active Emojis Emoticons You can use Emojis in your local notifications by concatenating the Emoji class with your text For push notifications you can use the Unicode text of the Emoji which can be found on http and use the format Please note that not all Emojis work on all platforms You should test the specific Emoji you want to use before using it in production await AwesomeNotifications content NotificationContent id id channelKey title are awesome too body body with a bunch of Emojis bigPicture notificationLayout You can find more than Emojis available in the Emoji class which includes most of the popular Emojis Notification Layout Types The appearance of a notification can be customized using different layouts Each layout type can be specified by including a respective source prefix before the path The available layout types are Default The default notification layout This layout will be used if no other layout is specified or if there is an error while loading the specified layout BigPicture This layout displays a large picture along with a small image attached to the notification BigText This layout can display more than two lines of text Inbox This layout can be used to list messages or items separated by lines ProgressBar This layout displays a progress bar such as a download progress bar Messaging This layout displays each notification as a chat conversation with one person Messaging Group This layout displays each notification as a chat conversation with more than one person groups MediaPlayer This layout displays a media controller with action buttons allowing the user to send commands without bringing the application to the foreground Media Source Types To display images in notifications you need to include the respective source prefix before the path Images can be defined using the following prefix types Asset images accessed through the Flutter asset method Example asset Network images accessed through an internet connection Example http s File images accessed through files stored on the device Example file Resource images accessed through drawable native resources On Android these files are stored inside project folder Example resource Note that icons and sounds can only be resource media types Unfortunately to protect your native resources on Android against minification please include the prefix in your resource file names The use of the tag shrinkResources to false inside or the command flutter build apk is not recommended For more information please visit Shrink obfuscate and optimize your app Notification Importance Defines the notification importance level as a hierarchy with Max being the most important and None being the least important Depending on the importance level the notification may have different behaviors such as making a sound appearing as a notification or not showing at all The possible importance levels are as follows Max Makes a sound and appears as a notification Higher Shows everywhere makes noise and peeks May use intents Default Shows everywhere makes noise but does not visually intrude Low Shows in the shade and potentially in the status bar see shouldHideSilentStatusBarIcons but is not audibly intrusive Min Only shows in the shade below the fold None Disables the respective channel Note that higher importance levels should only be used when necessary such as for critical or notifications Abusing higher importance levels can be intrusive to the user and negatively impact their experience OBS Unfortunately the channel importance can only be defined on the first time After that it can not be changed Wake Up Screen Notifications To send notifications that wake up the device screen even when it is locked you can set the wakeUpScreen property to true when creating a notification However on Android devices you will need to add the permission to your app file in order to use this feature Additionally you will need to include the android turnScreenOn property in the activity tag of your app file Here an example of how to add these properties to your file manifest xmlns http android application android android android Awesome Notifications for Flutter activity android android android true android singleTop android android adjustResize android true Note that the android turnScreenOn property will only work if the device screen is off If the device screen is already on the property will have no effect Full Screen Notifications only for Android Full screen notifications can be sent on Android by setting the fullScreenIntent property to true These notifications are displayed in full screen mode even when the device is locked When the notification is displayed the Android system may automatically trigger your app similar to when the user taps on it This allows you to display your page in full screen and customize it as desired However you can not control when your full screen notification will be called To enable the fullScreenIntent property you must add the android true property and the permission to your file inside the folder manifest xmlns http android application activity android android true For Android versions and above you must request the user consent to enable this feature using requestPermissionToSendNotifications Notification Structures NotificationContent content in Push data required NotificationContent id int channelKey String title String body

timeZone NO The time zone identifier in the ISO format String UTC UTC Common Known Issues Issue Targeting version and above requires that an explicit value for android exported be defined when intent filters are present Fix You need to add the attribute android true to any To fix this issue it recommended to request the changes to be made in the plugin repository instead and upgrade it in your to the latest version This ensures that the necessary changes are made without compromising the integrity of the local files For example you can add the following line of code to your file manifest xmlns http application android myapp android activity android android true To learn more about this issue and how to fix it please visit Android Safer component exporting Issue Notification is not showing up or is showing up inconsistently Fix This can happen due to various reasons such as channel not being registered properly notification not being triggered at the right time due device battery optimization settings and other ones First make sure that you have registered your notification channels properly and that your app is targeting at least API level Android or higher Check if the notification is triggered at the right time You may need to verify that the correct date and time have been set in the notification Check the device battery optimization settings as it can interfere with the scheduled notifications You can disable battery optimization for your app in the device settings If none of the above solutions work you can also try clearing the cache and data of your app uninstalling and reinstalling the app or checking for any conflicts with other apps that might be causing the issue To know more about it please visit Customize which resources to keep Issue My schedules are only displayed immediately after I open my app Fix Your app or device is under battery saving mode restrictions This may be different on some platforms for example Xiaomi already sets this feature for every new app installed You should educate your users about the need to disable battery saving modes and allow you to run background tasks Additionally you can ask your users to whitelist your app from any battery optimization feature that the device may have This can be done by adding your app to the unmonitored apps or battery optimization exceptions list depending on the device You can also try to use the package to help schedule background tasks This package allows you to schedule tasks that will run even when the app is not open and it has some features to help handle battery optimization To know more about it please visit documentation and Optimizing for Doze and App Standby for Android devices Issue DecoderBufferCallback not found not found Fix You need to update your Flutter version running flutter upgrade These methods were since version If you are already on the latest Flutter version and still encountering the issue make sure to also update your package to the latest version Issue Using bridging headers with module interfaces is unsupported Fix You need to set build settings options below in your Runner target Build libraries for distribution NO Only safe API extensions NO and in your Notification Extension target Build libraries for distribution NO Only safe API extensions YES Issue Invalid notification content Fix The notification sent via FCM services MUST respect the types of the respective Notification elements Otherwise your notification will be discarded as invalid one Also all the payload elements MUST be a String as the same way as you do in Local Notifications using dart code To see more information about each type please go to https Issue Undefined symbol Fix This error happens when the flutter dependecies are not copied to another target extensions Please remove the old target extensions and update your plugin to the last version available modifying your pod file according and running pod install after it Android Foreground Services Optional This feature is necessary to use all features available to some notification category as call notifications alarms full screen intent and to display background task progress to the user Since it is optional it was moved to a second library you can import as follows import The foreground service permission is NOT automatically added by this plugin and you only need to add it if you want to use Android foreground services In your inside the manifest tag add android Next you have to add the service tag to your Inside your application tag add service android android true android false android true android And finally to create the notification as foreground service use the method startForeground and set the notification category to Service foregroundStartMode foregroundServiceType content NotificationContent id body is running title Foreground Service channelKey bigPicture notificationLayout category actionButtons NotificationActionButton key label While the android name must exactly match this value you can configure the other parameters as you like although it is recommended to copy the values for android enabled android exported and android stopWithTask Suitable values for foregroundServiceType can be found here IMPORTANT If the icon of the notification is not set or not valid the notification will appear as a circle Make sure to always specify an valid transparent icon If you need help with this take a look at the examples Foreground Services behaviour on platforms other than Android On any

ResponsiveFramework includes a few custom widgets that supplement Flutter responsive capabilities Their usages are showcased in the demo projects ResponsiveValue ResponsiveVisibility ResponsiveConstraints ResponsiveRowColumn ResponsiveGridView ResponsiveScaledBox MaxWidthBox Legacy ReadMe and below ResponsiveWrapper Migration Migration Guide The remainder of the legacy ReadMe is preserved below as the concepts are still useful and used by the new widgets ResponsiveWrapper has been deprecated and removed The Problem Supporting multiple display sizes often means recreating the same layout multiple times Under the traditional Bootstrap approach building responsive UI is time consuming frustrating and repetitive Furthermore getting everything pixel perfect is near impossible and simple edits take hours The Solution Use Responsive Framework to automatically scale your UI AutoScale AutoScale shrinks and expands your layout proportionally preserving the exact look of your UI This eliminates the need to manually adapt layouts to mobile tablet and desktop Flutter default behavior is resize which Responsive Framework respects AutoScale is off by default and can be enabled at breakpoints by setting autoScale to true Breakpoints Breakpoints control responsive behavior at different screen sizes ResponsiveWrapper child breakpoints name MOBILE name TABLET name DESKTOP Breakpoints give you control over how your UI displays Introductory Concepts These concepts helps you start using the Responsive Framework and build an responsive app quickly Scale vs Resize Flutter default behavior is to resize your layout when the screen dimensions change Resizing a layout stretches it in the direction of an unconstrained width or height Any constrained dimension stays fixed which is why mobile app UIs look tiny on desktop The following example illustrates the difference between resizing and scaling An AppBar widget looks correct on a phone When viewed on a desktop however the AppBar is too short and the title looks too small Here is what happens under each behavior Resizing default the AppBar width is so it stretches to fill the available width The Toolbar height is fixed and stays Scaling the AppBar width stretches to fill the available width The height scales proportionally using an aspect ratio automatically calculated from the nearest ResponsiveBreakpoint As the width increases the height increases proportionally When scaled the AppBar looks correct on desktop up to a certain size Once the screen becomes too wide the AppBar starts to appear too large This is where breakpoints come in Breakpoint Configuration To adapt to a wide variety of screen sizes set breakpoints to control responsive behavior ResponsiveWrapper child maxWidth minWidth defaultScale true breakpoints name MOBILE name TABLET name DESKTOP name An arbitrary number of breakpoints can be set behavior can be mixed and matched below resize on small screens to avoid cramp and overflow errors resize on phones for native widget sizes scale on tablets to avoid elements appearing too small resize on desktops to use available space scale on extra large

lightweight library for parsing traversing querying transforming and building XML ReadmeChangelogExampleInstallingVersionsScoresDart XML Dart XML is a lightweight library for parsing traversing querying transforming and building XML documents This library provides a object model for accessing and manipulating XML documents as well as an comparable to SAX for incremental reading and processing of XML streams Furthermore it supports a large subset of XPath to simplify the querying of large documents This library is open source stable and well tested Development happens on GitHub Feel free to report issues or create a there General questions are best asked on StackOverflow The package is hosted on dart packages class documentation is created with every release Tutorial Installation Follow the installation instructions on dart packages Import the library into your Dart code using import This library makes extensive use of static extension methods If you import the library using a library prefix or only selectively show classes you might miss some of its functionality For historical reasons public classes have an Xml prefix so conflicts with other code should be rare Reading and Writing To read XML input use the factory method String input final bookshelfXml xml bookshelf book title en Growing a Language price book title en Learning XML price price final document bookshelfXml The resulting object is an instance of XmlDocument In case the document can not be parsed a XmlException is thrown To write back the parsed XML document simply call toString or toXmlString if you need more control print print pretty true indent To read XML from a file use the dart io library final file new File final document If your file is not encoded pass the correct encoding to readAsStringSync It is the responsibility of the caller to provide a standard Dart String using the default encoding To read and write large files you might want to use the API instead Traversing and Querying Accessors allow accessing nodes in the XML tree attributes returns the attributes of the node children returns the direct children of the node Both lists are mutable and support all common List methods such as add XmlNode addAll Iterable XmlNode insert int XmlNode and insertAll int Iterable XmlNode Trying to add a null value or an unsupported node type throws an XmlNodeTypeError error Nodes that are already part of a tree are not automatically moved you need to first create a copy as otherwise an XmlParentError is thrown XmlDocumentFragment nodes are automatically expanded and copies of their children are added There are methods to traverse the XML tree along different axes siblings returns an iterable over the nodes at the same level that proceed and follow this node in document order preceding returns an iterable over nodes preceding the opening tag of the current node in document order descendants returns an iterable over the descendants of the current node in document order This includes the attributes of the current node its children the grandchildren and so on following the nodes following the closing tag of the current node in document order ancestors returns an iterable over the ancestor nodes of the current node that is the parent the grandparent and so on Note that this is the only iterable that traverses nodes in reverse document order For example the descendants iterator could be used to extract all textual contents from an XML tree final textual XmlText text string print textual prints a Language XML and There are convenience helpers to filter by element nodes only childElements siblingElements precedingElements descendantElements followingElements and ancestorElements Additionally there are helpers to find elements with a specific tag getElement String name finds the first direct child with the provided tag name or null findElements String name finds direct children of the current node with the provided tag name findAllElements String name finds direct and indirect children of the current node with the provided tag name For example to find all the nodes with the title tag you could write final titles The above code returns a lazy iterator that recursively walks the XML document and yields all the element nodes with the requested tag name To extract the textual contents of an element call innerText titles element print prints a Language and This prints Growing a Language and Learning XML Similarly to compute the total price of all the books one could write the following expression final total element element a b a b print total prints Note that this first finds all the books and then extracts the price to avoid counting the price tag that is included in the bookshelf XPath To simplify accessing and extracting specific parts of a DOM document this library supports the most commonly used subset of XPath expressions a full XPath engine is outside the scope of this library To get started import the XPath library import This exposes the static extension method String expression that can be used on documents and any other XML DOM node The method returns an iterable over the matching XML DOM nodes Using the bookshelf data defined above we can write Find all the books in the bookshelf print Find the second book in the bookshelf print Find all the english titles anywhere in the document print en Find all the books with an english title print en Sum up the prices of all the books final total node a b a b print total prints Building While it is possible to instantiate and compose XmlDocument XmlElement and XmlText nodes manually the XmlBuilder provides a simple fluent API to build complete XML trees To create the above bookshelf example one would write final builder XmlBuilder nest nest nest a Language nest nest nest XML nest nest final document The element method supports optional named arguments The most common is the nest argument which is used to insert contents into the element In most cases this will be a function that calls more methods on the builder to define attributes declare namespaces and add child elements However the argument can also be a string or an arbitrary Dart object that is converted to a string and added as a text node While attributes can be defined from within the element for simplicity there is also an argument attributes that takes a map to define simple pairs Furthermore we can provide a URI as the namespace of the element using namespace and declare new namespace prefixes using namespaces For details see the documentation of the method The builder pattern allows you to easily extract repeated parts into specific methods In the example above one could put the part writing a book into a separate method as follows void buildBook XmlBuilder builder String title String language num price nest nest language title nest price The above buildDocument method returns the built document To attach built nodes into an existing XML document use buildFragment Once the builder returns the built node its internal state is reset final builder XmlBuilder buildBook builder War of the Worlds buildBook builder extraordinaries Reading large XML files and instantiating their DOM into the memory can be expensive As an alternative this library provides the possibility to read and transform XML documents as a sequence of events using Dart Iterables or Streams These approaches are comparable to SAX parsing known from other libraries import Iterables In the simplest case you can get a Iterable XmlEvent over the input string using the following code This parses the input lazily and only parses input when requested parseEvents bookshelfXml XmlTextEvent event text print The function parseEvents supports various other options see its documentation for further examples This approach requires the whole input to be available at the beginning and does not work if the data itself is only available asynchronous such as coming from a slow network connection A more flexible but also more complicated API is provided with Dart Streams Streams To asynchronously parse and process events directly from a file or HTTP stream use the provided extension methods on Stream to convert between streams of strings events and DOM tree nodes For more control the underlying Codec and Converter implementations can be used Various other transformations are provided to simplify processing complex streams Normalizes a sequence of XmlEvent objects by removing empty and combining adjacent text events Stream List

XmlEvent For example the following snippet downloads data from the Internet converts the input to a Dart String decodes the stream of characters to XmlEvents and finally normalizes and prints the events final url final request await HttpClient url final response await await response onText event print Similarly the following snippet extracts with location information from a file converts the XML events to XML nodes and finally prints out the containing text final file File await event nodes nodes node print A common challenge when processing XML event streams is the lack of hierarchical information thus it is very hard to figure out parent dependencies such as looking up a namespace URI The transformation validates the hierarchy and annotates the events with their parent event This enables features such as parentEvent and the namespaceUri accessor and makes mapping and selecting events considerably simpler For example await shiporderXsd event nodes nodes node print pretty true

months ago mock framework inspired by Mockito with APIs for Fakes Mocks behavior verification and ReadmeChangelogExampleInstallingVersionsScores Mock library for Dart inspired by Mockito Let create mocks Mockito supports Dart new null safety language feature in Dart primarily with code generation To use Mockito generated mock classes add a dependency in your package file under something like For alternatives to the code generation API see the Let start with a Dart library import import Annotation which generates the library and the MockCat class GenerateNiceMocks MockSpec Cat import Real class class Cat String sound Meow bool eatFood String food bool hungry true Future void chew async print Chewing int walk List String places void sleep void hunt String place String prey int lives void main Create mock object var cat MockCat By annotating the import of a library with GenerateNiceMocks you are directing Mockito code generation to write a mock class for each real class listed in a new library The next step is to run in order to generate this new library flutter pub run build OR dart run build will generate a file with a name based on the file containing the GenerateNiceMocks annotation In the above example we import the generated library as NOTE by default only annotations in files under are processed if you want to add Mockito annotations in other places you will need to add a file to your project see this SO answer The generated mock class MockCat extends Mockito Mock class and implements the Cat class giving us a class which supports stubbing and verifying Let verify some behavior Interact with the mock object Verify the interaction verify Once created the mock instance will remember all interactions Then you can selectively verify or verifyInOrder or verifyNever the interactions you are interested in How about some stubbing Stub a mock method before interacting when Purr expect Purr You can call it again expect Purr Let change the stub when Meow expect Meow You can stub getters when expect You can stub a method to throw when RangeError expect throwsRangeError We can calculate a response at call time var responses Purr Meow when expect Purr expect Meow We can stub a method with multiple calls that happened in a particular order when Purr Meow expect Purr expect Meow expect throwsA isA StateError The when thenReturn thenAnswer and thenThrow APIs provide a stubbing mechanism to override this behavior Once stubbed the method will always return stubbed value regardless of how many times it is called If a method invocation matches multiple stubs the one which was declared last will be used It is worth noting that stubbing and verifying only works on methods of a mocked class in this case an instance of MockCat must be used not an instance of Cat A quick word on async stubbing Using thenReturn to return a Future or Stream will throw an ArgumentError This is because it can lead to unexpected behaviors For example If the method is stubbed in a different zone than the zone that consumes the Future unexpected behavior could occur If the method is stubbed to return a failed Future or Stream and it does get consumed in the same run loop it might get consumed by the global exception handler instead of an exception handler the consumer applies Instead use thenAnswer to stub methods that return a Future or Stream BAD when when GOOD when async when If for some reason you desire the behavior of thenReturn you can return a instance Use the above method unless you sure you want to create the Future ahead of time final future when future Argument matchers Mockito provides the concept of the argument matcher using the class ArgMatcher to capture arguments and to track how named arguments are passed In most cases both plain arguments and argument matchers can be passed into mock methods You can use plain arguments themselves when fish true including collections when roof tree or matchers when argThat startsWith dry false when any false or mix arguments with matchers when argThat startsWith dry hungry true true expect fish isTrue expect roof tree equals expect dry food isFalse expect dry food hungry true isTrue You can also verify using an argument matcher verify fish verify roof tree verify argThat contains food You can verify setters verify If an argument other than an ArgMatcher like any anyNamed argThat captureThat etc is passed to a mock method then the equals matcher is used for argument matching If you need more strict matching consider using argThat identical arg However note that null can not be used as an argument adjacent to ArgMatcher arguments nor as an value passed as a named argument For example verify backyard null OK no arg matchers verify argThat contains yard null BAD adjacent null verify argThat contains yard argThat isNull OK wrapped in an arg matcher verify Milk hungry null BAD null as a named argument verify Milk hungry argThat isNull BAD null as a named argument Named arguments Mockito currently has an awkward nuisance to its syntax named arguments and argument matchers require more specification than you might think you must declare the name of the argument in the argument matcher This is because we ca rely on the position of a named argument and the language provide a mechanism to answer Is this element being used as a named element GOOD argument matchers include their names when any hungry anyNamed true when any hungry argThat isNotNull named false when any hungry captureAnyNamed false when any hungry captureThat isNotNull named true BAD argument matchers do not include their names when any hungry any true when any hungry argThat isNotNull false when any hungry captureAny false when any hungry captureThat isNotNull true Verifying exact number of invocations at least x never Use verify or verifyNever Exact number of invocations verify Or using matcher verify greaterThan Or never called verifyNever any Verification in order Use verifyInOrder Milk Fish verifyInOrder Milk Fish Verification in order is flexible you do have to verify all interactions but only those that you are interested in testing in order Making sure interaction s never happened on mock Use verifyZeroInteractions verifyZeroInteractions cat Finding redundant invocations Use verifyNoMoreInteractions verify verifyNoMoreInteractions cat Capturing arguments for further assertions Use the captureAny captureThat and captureAnyNamed argument matchers Simple capture Fish expect verify captureAny Fish Capture multiple calls Milk Fish expect verify captureAny Milk Fish Conditional capture Milk Fish expect verify captureThat startsWith F Fish Waiting for an interaction Use untilCalled Waiting for a call Fish await untilCalled Completes when is called Waiting for a call that has already happened Fish await untilCalled any Completes immediately Nice mocks vs classic mocks Mockito provides two APIs for generating mocks the GenerateNiceMocks annotation and the GenerateMocks annotation The recommended API is GenerateNiceMocks The difference between these two APIs is in the behavior of a generated mock class when a method is called and no stub could be found For example void main var cat MockCat The method returns a String but no stub has been made with when so what should the code do What is the missing stub behavior The missing stub behavior of a mock class generated with GenerateMocks is to throw an exception The missing stub behavior of a mock class generated with GenerateNiceMocks is to return a simple legal value for example a value for a return type The value should not be used in any way it is returned solely to avoid a runtime type exception Mocking a Function type To create mocks for Function objects write an abstract class with a method for each function type signature that needs to be mocked The methods can be torn off and individually stubbed and verified GenerateMocks Cat Callbacks import abstract class Callbacks Cat findCat String name void main var mockCat MockCat var findCatCallback MockCallbacks when findCatCallback mockCat Writing a fake You can also write a simple fake class that implements a real class by extending Fake Fake allows your subclass to satisfy the implementation of your real class without overriding the methods that are used in your test the Fake class implements the default behavior of throwing UnimplementedError which you can override in your fake class Fake class class FakeCat extends Fake implements Cat override bool eatFood String food bool hungry print eat food return true void main Create a new fake Cat at runtime var cat FakeCat Milk Prints eat Milk Resetting mocks Use reset Clearing collected interactions Fish clearInteractions cat Fish verify Fish Resetting stubs and collected interactions when Fish true Fish reset cat when any false expect Fish false Debugging Use logInvocations and throwOnMissingStub Print all collected invocations of any mock methods of a list of mock objects logInvocations catOne catTwo Throw every time that a mock method is called without a stub being matched throwOnMissingStub cat Best Practices Testing with real objects is preferred over testing with mocks if you can construct a real instance for your tests you should If there are no calls to verify in your test it is a strong signal that you may not need mocks at all though it also OK to use a Mock like a stub Data models never need to be mocked if they can be constructed with stubbed data When it not possible to use the real object a tested implementation of a fake is the next best thing it more likely to behave similarly to the real class than responses stubbed out in tests Finally an object which extends Fake using manually overridden methods is preferred over an object which extends Mock used as either a stub or a mock A class which extends Mock should never stub out its own responses with when in its constructor or anywhere else Stubbed responses should be defined in the tests where they are used For responses controlled outside of the test use override methods for either the entire interface or with extends Fake to skip some parts of the interface Similarly a class which extends Mock should never have any implementation It should not define any override methods and it should not mixin any implementations Actual member definitions ca be stubbed by tests and be tracked and verified by Mockito A mix of test defined stubbed responses and mock defined overrides will lead to confusion It is OK to define static utilities on a class which extends

a library for reactively managing the state of your applications Use the power of observables actions and reactions to supercharge your Dart and Flutter ReadmeChangelogExampleInstallingVersionsScoresLanguage English Português en MobX for the Dart language Supercharge the in your Dart apps with Transparent Functional Reactive Programming TFRP Introduction Core Concepts Observables observable readonly computed Actions Reactions Contributing Introduction MobX is a library that makes it simple to connect the reactive data of your application with the UI This wiring is completely automatic and feels very natural As the you focus purely on what needs to be consumed in the UI and elsewhere without worrying about keeping the two in sync It not really magic but it does have some smarts around what is being consumed observables and where reactions and automatically tracks it for you When the observables change all reactions are What interesting is that these reactions can be anything from a simple console log a network call to the UI MobX has been a very effective library for the JavaScript apps and this port to the Dart language aims to bring the same levels of productivity Go deep For a deeper coverage of MobX do check out MobX Quick Start Guide Although the book uses the JavaScript version of MobX nearly all of the concepts are applicable to Dart and Flutter Core Concepts At the heart of MobX are three important concepts Observables Actions and Reactions Observables Observables represent the of your application They can be simple scalars to complex object trees By defining the state of the application as a tree of observables you can expose a that the UI or other observers in the app consume A simple is represented by the following observable import final counter Observable More complex observables such as classes can be created as well class Counter Counter increment Action final Observable int get value set value int newValue newValue Action increment void On first sight this does look like some boilerplate code which can quickly go out of hand This is why we added to the mix that allows you to replace the above code with the following import part class Counter CounterBase with Counter abstract class CounterBase with Store observable int value action void increment Note the use of annotations to mark the observable properties of the class Yes there is some header boilerplate here but its fixed for any class As you build more complex classes this boilerplate will fade away and you will mostly focus on the code within the braces Note Annotations are available via the package Readonly If you want to reduce your code you may want to swap observable for readonly For every private variable it generates a public getter such that the client of your store ca change its value Read more about it here Computed Observables What can be derived should be derived Automatically The state of your application consists of and The is state inherent to the domain you are dealing with For example if you have a Contact entity the firstName and lastName form the of Contact However fullName is obtained by combining firstName and lastName Such derived state that depends on or other is called a Computed Observable It is automatically kept in sync when its underlying observables change State in MobX import part class Contact ContactBase with Contact abstract class ContactBase with Store observable String firstName observable String lastName computed String get fullName firstName lastName In the example above fullName is automatically kept in sync if either firstName lastName changes Actions Actions are how you mutate the observables Rather than mutating them directly actions add a semantic meaning to the mutations For example instead of just doing firing an increment action carries more meaning Besides actions also batch up all the notifications and ensure the changes are notified only after they complete Thus the observers are notified only upon the atomic completion of the action Note that actions can also be nested in which case the notifications go out when the action has completed final counter Observable final increment Action When creating actions inside a class you can take advantage of annotations import part class Counter CounterBase with Counter abstract class CounterBase with Store observable int value action void increment Reactions Reactions complete the MobX triad of observables actions and reactions They are the observers of the and get notified whenever an observable they track is changed Reactions come in few flavors as listed below All of them return a ReactionDisposer a function that can be called to dispose the reaction One striking feature of reactions is that they automatically track all the observables without any explicit wiring The act of reading an observable within a reaction is enough to track it The code you write with MobX appears to be literally ReactionDisposer autorun Function Reaction fn Runs the reaction immediately and also on any change in the observables used inside fn import final greeting Observable World final dispose autorun print MobX Done with the autorun dispose Prints Hello World Hello MobX ReactionDisposer reaction T T Function Reaction fn void Function T effect Monitors the observables used inside the fn function and runs the effect when the fn function returns a different value Only the observables inside fn are tracked import final greeting Observable World final dispose reaction msg print msg MobX Cause a change Done with the reaction dispose Prints Hello MobX ReactionDisposer when bool Function Reaction predicate void Function effect Monitors the observables used inside predicate and runs the effect when it returns true After the effect is run when automatically disposes itself So you can think of when as a reaction You can also dispose when import final greeting Observable World final dispose when MobX print greeted MobX MobX Causes a change runs effect and disposes Prints Someone greeted MobX Future void asyncWhen bool Function Reaction predicate Similar to when but returns a Future which is fulfilled when the predicate returns true This is a convenient way of waiting for the predicate to turn true final completed Observable false void waitForCompletion async await asyncWhen true print Observer One of the most visual reactions in the app is the UI The Observer widget which is part of the package provides a granular observer of the observables used in its builder function Whenever these observables change Observer rebuilds and renders Below is the Counter example in its entirety import import import part class Counter CounterBase with Counter abstract class CounterBase with Store observable int value action void increment class CounterExample extends StatefulWidget const CounterExample Key key super key key override createState class extends State CounterExample final Counter override Widget build BuildContext context Scaffold appBar AppBar title const Text body Center child Column mainAxisAlignment

Latest Prerelease flexible widget for user notification Customize your text button duration animations and much more For Android devs it is made to replace Snackbars and Use this package if you need more customization when notifying your user For Android developers it is made to substitute toasts and snackbars IOS developers I do know what you use there but you will like it See the install instructions Quick reference Since customization requires a lot of properties here is a quick cheatsheet Property What does it do title The title displayed to the user titleColor The title color displayed to the user titleSize The title size displayed to the user message The message displayed to the user messageColor The message color displayed to the user messageSize The message size displayed to the user titleText Replaces title Although this accepts a widget it is meant to receive Text or RichText messageText Replaces message Although this accepts a widget it is meant to receive Text or RichText icon You can use any widget here but I recommend Icon or Image as indication of what kind of message you are displaying Other widgets may break the layout shouldIconPulse An option to animate the icon if present Defaults to true maxWidth Used to limit Flushbar width usually on large screens margin Adds a custom margin to Flushbar padding Adds a custom padding to Flushbar The default follows material design guide line borderRadius Adds a radius to specified corners of Flushbar Best combined with margin I do not recommend using it with showProgressIndicator or leftBarIndicatorColor textDirection by default context to know whether it would be or borderColor Adds a border to every side of Flushbar I do not recommend using it with showProgressIndicator or leftBarIndicatorColor borderWidth Changes the width of the border if borderColor is specified backgroundColor Flushbar background color Will be ignored if backgroundGradient is not null leftBarIndicatorColor If not null shows a left vertical bar to better indicate the humor of the notification It is not possible to use it with a Form and I do not recommend using it with LinearProgressIndicator boxShadows The shadows generated by Flushbar Leave it null if you do want a shadow You can use more than one if you feel the need Check this example backgroundGradient Flushbar background gradient Makes backgroundColor be ignored mainButton Use if you need an action from the user FlatButton is recommended here onTap A callback that registers the user click anywhere An alternative to mainButton duration How long until Flushbar will hide itself be dismissed To make it indefinite leave it null isDismissible Determines if the user can swipe or click the overlay if routeBlur to dismiss It is recommended that you set duration null if this is false If the user swipes to dismiss or clicks the overlay no value will be returned dismissDirection by default Can also be in which case both left and right dismiss are allowed flushbarPosition Flushbar can be based on or on of your screen is the default flushbarStyle Flushbar can be floating or be grounded to the edge of

animation used when dismiss is called is default animationDuration Use it to speed up or slow down the animation duration showProgressIndicator true if you want to show a LinearProgressIndicator If

LinearProgressIndicator configuration parameter barBlur Default is If different than blurs only Flushbar background To take effect make sure your backgroundColor has some opacity The greater the value the greater the blur blockBackgroundInteraction Determines if user can interact with the screen behind it If this is false routeBlur and routeColor will be ignored routeBlur Default is If different than creates a blurred overlay that prevents the user from interacting with the screen The greater the value the greater the blur It does not take effect if blockBackgroundInteraction is false routeColor Default is Only takes effect if routeBlur Make sure you use a color with transparency It does not take effect if blockBackgroundInteraction is false userInputForm A TextFormField in case you want a simple user input Every other widget is ignored if this is not null onStatusChanged a callback for you to listen to the different Flushbar status Quick tip If you use a lot of those properties it makes sense to make a factory to help with your Flushbar base appearance Things like shadows padding margins text styles usually do change within the app Take a look at FlushbarHelper class and use it as an example We are on YouTube While studying Flutter I stumbled on two amazing tutorials on how to use Flushbar Make sure you show those guys some love A beginners tutorial by Matej Rešetár A more advanced usage by Javier González Rodríguez Getting Started The examples bellow were updated for version Changes might have been made See the changelog if any of the examples do not reflect Flushbar current state The possibilities A basic Flushbar The most basic Flushbar uses only a message Failing to provide it before you call show will result in a runtime error Duration if not provided will create an infinite Flushbar only dismissible by code back button clicks or a drag case isDismissible is set to true Note that only message is a required parameter All the other ones are
